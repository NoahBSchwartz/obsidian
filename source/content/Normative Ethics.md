Normative Ethics: addressing questions about the standards of morals (what determines if actions are moral)
- Consequentialism: the moral quality of an act is ENTIRELY determined by the moral quality of consequence
- Non-consequentialism: 
	1. Particularism: go case by case (ie. there are particulars in every situation)
	2. Generalism: (ie. act on a general rule to maximize well being)
	- Category of Views (Rules-Based)
		- Virtue Ethics (Aristotelian): you need to pick which traits are virtuous (ie. cowardice -> bravery -> foolhardiness)
		- Deontology (Kantian): Duty-based
			- Categorical Imperative: treat all people as if they are independent agents and don't use them (even if treating them as a tool will yield better results in the long run )
			- Contractarianism: moral requirements come from the duties we have because we're part of society (like all the social agreements we have to make society work better
		- Rights-Theories
			- Libertarianism: right to autonomy for all people (you can't punch people because that affects their autonomy)
- Utilitarianism
	- Act Utilitarianism: the morally best acts are the ones that contribute to the greatest net overall welfare 
	- Rule Utilitarianism: the morally best acts are performed in accordance with rules of action

- Cognitivism: If you say "kicking puppies is wrong" then you believe it
	- Non-Cognitivism: if you say "kicking puppies is wrong" you might not believe it but you're expressing disapproval 
- Moral Realism: there are actual facts about the world that determine morality
	- Naturalism: moral facts are determined by nature
	- Non-naturalism: maybe morals rely on things like god or on something intangible (but not in nature)
- Error Theory: moral language is misguided and all moral judgements are false
Applied Ethics: focusses on real world issues
Metaethics: studies epistemic and semantic issues relating to morality (ie. what are moral facts, what is moral language)
