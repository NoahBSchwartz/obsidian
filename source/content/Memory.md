# Remembering
- Definition: The persistence of learning over time
- Domains of Memory Processing
	1. Encoding: process of putting information into memory 
		- Deep Processing vs Shallow Processing: Surface level, distracted attention is much worse than full selective attention
			- Maintenance Rehearsal (effortful storage): Rote process of repeating items over and over to maintain them in memory (Shallow Processing)
			- Relational (Elaborative) Rehearsal (effortful storage): active process of thinking about and forming connections among ideas (Deep Processing)
	2. Storage: Process of maintaining information in memory
		- Multistore Model (Atkinson and Shiffrin): theorized that memory involves three separate modes (aka the Information Processing Model)
			1. Sensory Memory: Brief store of immediate sensory information 
				- Echoic (auditory, like hearing someone's question a few seconds after)
				- Iconic (visual, like seeing an after-image)
			1. Short-Term/ Working Memory: Passive and limited-capacity store of information
				- Duration: Information lasts 20-30 seconds unless rehearsed
				- Capacity: STM can hold 5-9 units of information (Magical Number 7 +- 2) George Miller was cognitive psychologist who found this
				- Chunking: Organization of Information into meaningful units (think of digits 17761492, chunk into dates: 1776 1492)
			2. Working Memory: Modern psychologists replace STM with working memory. System for temporarily storing and managing info required to carry out cognitive tasks (not a passive single store like STM, doesn't depend as much on time)
			3. Long-Term Memory: almost limitless capacity and relatively permanent
				- Long-Term Potentiation: increase in a cell's firing potential after brief, rapid stimulation
				- Boosting the protein CREB might be related to transfer of working memories to long-term memories
				- Memories form in the hippocampus and temporal lobe
				- Explicit Memory: conscious memory of a particular fact or event (really trying to remember). In frontal lobes and hippocampus. You can declare these memories in word so it's sometimes called Declarative Memory
					- Autobiographical Memory: recall of past experiences that occurred in one's personal life
					- Episodic Memory: events experienced at a particular time and place 
					- Semantic Memory: knowledge of general facts and concepts that give meaning to info (who's the president of the US). 
						- Leveraged because you can process the meaning of what your learning to improve memory
				- Implicit Memory (Non-Declarative): memory without specific awareness (cerebellum and basal ganglia)
					- Procedural Memory: long-term memory for skills involved in specific tasks (riding a bike)
					- Automaticity: behavior or cognitive process carried out rapidly and without effort (muscle memory
					- Priming: recent experiences with an event or stimulus influences later processing 
					- Sensory memory: visual information stored cortical areas involved in visual perception. Sound is stored in cortical areas involved in auditory perception. When you remember, these cortical areas are reactivated
				- Consolidation: "Setting" of new memory into long term storage
				- Reconsolidation: memories can change each time they are retrieved. Each memory is of the previous retrieval not the original experience
	1. Retrieval: Process of recovering info from storage (2 Methods)
		- Recall: First, generate information. 2nd, recognize if it's correct or incorrect
		- Recognition: Recognize information without generating it 
		- Primacy effect: Recall is good for items which appear at the first of a list
		- Zeigarnik Effect: Incomplete tasks are recalled better than complete tasks 
		- Exceptional Cases
			- Flashbulb Memory: Seemingly frozen memory of a significant event (emotions of an event heavy affect it, rehearsing the story helps people remember it, knowledge that the event is important makes brain treat it importantly)
			- Eidetic Memory: Capacity to store mental images for longer than average (most eidetikers are children)
			- Memorists (expert memory): someone with exceptional retrieval skills (faster and more efficient than average, sometime use mnemonic devices )
			- Mnemonics: memory tricks like imagery, acronyms...
# Forgetting
- The failure to retrieve information stored in long term memory
- Hermann Ebbinghaus would memorize long lists of symbols to document the forgetting curve
	- He found a rapid forgetting after first hours of learning, eventually slowing and leveling out over days
- Models of Forgetting:
	1. Decay Theory: memories decay over a long period of time
	2. Interference Theory: forgetting is due to the negative influence of competing information
		- Retroactive Interference: New info interferes with old memories (like driving an automatic makes you forget manual)
		- Proactive Interference: Old memories interfere with new memories (like learning a new language is harder when you already know a language)
	3. Cue-Dependent Forgetting: failure to recall memory due to missing cues that were present at the time of encoding
		- Retrieval Cues: things like pictures details that help you remember something
		- State-Dependent Retrieval: the state (mental, physical, emotional) you are when you learn something affects when you can recall information
		- Tip of the Tongue Phenomenon (aka. cue dependence): part of info is there but can't quite recall
	4. Repression (Sigmund Freud): Forgetting of painful memories and unacceptable impulses (pushed into the unconscious)
	5. Reconstructive Memory: process of recreating an experience or event that has been partially stored in memory (could lead to false memories)
		- Elizabeth Loftus documented that eyewitness testimony was very unreliable 
			- Study 1: Loftus and John Palmer (1974) looked at how language can impact witness testimony (using car crashes and changing wording of question)
			- Study 2: They did the same study with a week of gap in between 
- Amnesia: pure memory loss (often without damage to other cognitive functions)
	- Organic Amnesia: forgetting occurs because of physical damage
		- Anterograde Amnesia: can't remember info AFTER trauma
		- Retrograde Amnesia: can't remember info BEFORE trauma
