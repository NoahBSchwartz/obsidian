Composed of 17 autonomous communities and 2 autonomous cities
- Autonomous communities (no constitution): mainly responsible for management of health care, education, and social services
	Note: Some regions have separate language and culture (hope to become independent): Catalonia (speak Catalan), Basque Country (speak Basque), Galicia (speak Galician), Valencia (speak Valencian)
	1. Autonomous Community Funding
		1. Common Regime: system that combines assigned taxes (taxes set by central government) and regional revenue
		2. Canary Islands (has independent system): reduced corporate tax, lower value-added tax, income tax for individuals
		3. Charter System (Basque Country and Navarre): financed exclusively by local taxes, pay the central government annually for public good and services (Note: Catalonia also wants this system)
	2. State of Autonomies: institutional framework for last 20 years, dictates how power is broken down
		- Current Times
			- Statute of Autonomy Reforms: nationalist elites demand special treatment (ie. Catalonia and Basque Country should get more resources, threatened separation from Spain since 1990s). They dislike funding model from 2009
	3. Political Parties Opinions
		1. Spanish Socialists: several nations can make up Spain (federal vision)
		2. Popular Party (ie. Vox = far right party):  there's just one Spain (centralist conception)
		3. Other National Forces: either want to strengthen State of Autonomies or majorly revise (ie. right to decide)
			- (Sumar Group = in favor of plurinationality (federal development view))

	4. Challenges to Autonomous System
		- Constitutions
			1. Castilian is the official Spanish language of the State
			2. Other Spanish languages might become official in their communities
