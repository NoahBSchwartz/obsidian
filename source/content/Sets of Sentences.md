- Jointly Satisfiable: if there in some row of the the truth table where all sentences are true
- Jointly Inconsistent: if there are no rows of the truth table where all sentences are true 
- Entailment (⊢): if there are no rows of the truth table where A1 -> An are all true and B is false (when applied to arguments, entailment = validity)
	Ex. `{A1, A2, A3} ⊢ B`
