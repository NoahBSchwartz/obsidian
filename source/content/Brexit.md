# History
- Northern Ireland
	1. Northern Ireland Conflict (1968-1998): violent struggle between protestants and republicans
	2. Peaceful solution involving both UK and Irish governments was reached in 1998 (Northern Ireland Assembly)
	When Brexit happened, it was unclear what to do with border (UK is not in EU and Northern Ireland is part of UK, but Ireland is in EU so should ppl be allowed to come and go as they pleased between Northern Ireland and Ireland?)
# Arguments for Leaving
1. Sovereignty: UK wanted to regain full control over its laws and decision-making
2. Membership Fee: UK was net contributor to EU budget (and it's contributions had increased as economy grew)
3. Trade: leaving EU would allow UK to negotiate its own independent trade deals w other countries
4. Misc:
	- Immigration: UK would regain full control of immigration, Security: UK could develop its own security policies, World Affairs: UK could become truly independent power
# Timeline
1. 2015: Tory Party's victory triggered commitment to hold a referendum
2. 2016: Prime Minister David Cameron announced referendum on UK's membership in EU (then resigned when people voted to leave)
	- Invoked Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty (gives both sides 2 year to decide on terms of split)
3. Theresa May triggered the process in 2017
4. Leave won by very small margin 
	- England wanted to leave more than Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales
	- Older less-educated people were more likely to want to leave
5. Scheduled to leave EU in 2019 but withdrawal request was rejected so left 2020 (bc Boris Johnson made revisions). Transition period took a couple of months
	- Key Withdrawal Terms: transition period = give UK and EU time to reach trade deal, citizen's rights commitment = EU citizens and their families could live and work in the UK and vice versa, UK expected to pay $40 billion
	- EU UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement: free trade agreement for goods, cooperation on economic social and environmental issues
	- Misc Additional Treaties: agreement on exchange of classified info, agreement on nuclear energy sharing, EU UK Defense Cooperation Agreement, Europe Intervention Initiative, European Intervention Initiative, Joint Expeditionary Force, EU-UK partnership Council, Participation in International Forums
	- Northern Ireland Protocol: guarantees that physical border checks would not be reintroduced in Northern Ireland 
		- If needed, there would be a temporary customs union covering the whole of the UK
6. Post Transition Arrangements
	- UK and EU have temporary entry for business purposes, Visa-free travel for short term visits, Cooperation on illegal immigration
	- WIndsor Framework: builds on Northern Ireland Protocol 
		- Before, products were checked at ports in Northern Ireland on arrival. After, there were 2 lanes: if it got sent to Northern Ireland it didn't need to be checked but if it was destined for Ireland and EU then checks were carried out 
	- EU UK Cooporation on Gibraltar (bc Britain owns it): Spain and UK decided that Gibraltar should remain in the EU because it would benefit from policies (96% of Gibraltarians voted against Brexit), minimal border checks
