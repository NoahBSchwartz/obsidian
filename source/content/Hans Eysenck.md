- Eysenck's Trait Theory: proposed that personality traits have 3 dimensions. 
	1. How outgoing people are (introvert/ extrovert)
	2. Whether their emotions tend to be stable or unstable (consistency in moods and emotions). Inconsistency is known as being neurotic
	3. Psychoticism: mix of aggression, poor impulse control, self-centeredness, lack of empathy 
- Five-Factor Trait Theory: Identifies the big five personality traits (openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism)
	- Whether someone is an introvert depends on their degree of arousal. This is based on processing in the reticular activating system which affects alertness
