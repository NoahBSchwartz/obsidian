# Gene Expression: 
- Examines the processes that turn genes on and off. Reveals that your environment affects how your genes are expressed and therefore how they influence your brain
- Genotype: Combination of all of someone's genes
- Phenotype: Combination of all of someone's physical and psychological characteristics 
# Behavioral Genetics: 
- Study of how genes and environment interact to influence mental activity and behavior
- Twin studies: compare similarities between different types of twins to determine the genetic basis of specific traits
	- Researchers compare how similar dizygotic twins are in phenotype (fraternal) to how similar monozygotic (identical) twins are
- Epigenetics: Looks at how environment affects gene exposure
	- Found that environments don't alter the genes themselves but does alter when the genes are expressed (ie. living under stress can make some genes more or less active)
	- These environmental impacts can span generations (a father who went through famine is more likely to have obese sons)
