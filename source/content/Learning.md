The change in organism's behavior resulting from past experience 
- Stimulus: event or object that stimulates behavior
- Response: Reaction to a stimulus
# Classical Conditioning (Ivan Pavlov)
- Ivan Pavlov was a Russian physiologist
- Form of learning where neutral stimulus is associated with a meaningful stimulus (leading to conditioned behavior)
	1. Unconditioned Stimulus (UCS): stimulus that triggers an automatic or unconditioned response (meat)
		- Unconditioned Reflex: unlearned response (salivation)
	2. Conditioned Stimulus (CS): Pair the neutral stimulus with the conditioned stimulus (bell)
		- Conditioned Reflex: Learned response to the conditioned stimulus (salivation)
- Major Conditioning Processes
	- Acquisition: initial step of establishing and strengthening a response
		- Wait around a half second - a second between bell and food
	- Extinction: gradual fading of a response when CS (bell) is not followed by UCS (meat) after a couple of trials
		- Spontaneous Recovery:  when an extinguished response is relearned (the bell is once again paired with the meat)
	- Generalization: tendency to respond to stimuli that are similar to the CS (bells with different tunes still trigger salivation)
	- Discrimination: ability to distinguish between CS and another similar stimuli (bell's tune is too far apart to trigger salivation)
# Classical Behaviorism (John B. Watson)
- Differed from Pavlov because he conditioned human participants towards non-reflexive behavior. He created the field of behaviorism
- Conditioned Emotional Response: Classical conditioning of emotional behavior (Watson and Rosalie Rainer 1919)
	- Used infants (baby named Little Albert B. was most famous)
	- The UCS was a loud noise to scare the baby, and fear was the UCR. They paired this with the neutral stimulus of a white rat
	- It was successful, eventually seeing the rat produced fear
	- Were never able to counter condition
- Mary Cover Jones (1924): Studied Little Peter to finally be able to counter-condition fear
	- Counter-conditioning became the basis for modern behavioral therapy
# Operant Conditioning (B.F. Skinner)
- Based on: Behavior is strengthened or weakened depending on the consequences that follow it
	- Different from Pavlovian Conditioning because pavlov focus on what happens before behavior while Skinner focusses after behavior
	- what behavior did king describe when he talked about operant conditioning (kid knocking over a vase)
- Operant behavior: Response shaped by its consequences (either reinforcement or punishment) 
- Continuous Reinforcement: Any event that strengthens the behavior that it follows
	- Positive Reinforcement: Stimuli that increase the probability that behavior will happen again (ie. Given allowance for cleaning room)
	- Negative Reinforcement: taken away to increase behavior (ie. Remove beeping when put on seat belt)
	- Punishment: not the same thing as reinforcement, any aversive event that weakens the behavior that it follows
	- Positive Punishment: given to decrease behavior (ie. Reprimanded for online shopping at work)
	- Negative Punishment: taken away to decrease behavior (ie. Lose cell phone for kicking brother)
	- Effectiveness of Punishment: reinforcement is usually more effective.
		- Punishment could have undesirable side effects (subject can start hating the person giving them instructions)
		- Punishment must be administered immediately after the behavior every time it happens (you can't punish a dog for pooping 20 minutes after it happens)
		- emotionally overwhelming
		- Must give explanation for the punishment
		- Doesn't give subject an example of a good response to a situation 
	- Effective Reinforcement: 
		- Reinforcer must be reinforcing and contingent
		- Reinforce on a variable schedule (this is why gambling is addictive)
		- Shaping: gradual process of reinforcing behaviors that are closer and closer approximations of a desired behavior until the desired behavior is achieved
- Operant Chamber: Sound-proof chamber used to shape behavior (ie. animal manipulates a press bar or key to obtain an enforcer (the food))
	- Variable Ratio (aka schedules of reinforcement): when the number of bar presses needed to get the food varies (this is why gambling works)
	- Aka Skinner Box: box that contains a responding mechanism and a device capable of delivering a consequence to an animal in the box whenever it makes the desired response
		- Azrin, Hutchinson, and Hake (1966): Study on extinction. Two pigeons in one Skinner box. Only one gets rewarded for pecking button. Once the reward stops, that pigeons gets frustrated and takes it out on the other (innocent) pigeon.
		- 
- Behavior Control: broad attempts to shape and model behavior (Walden 2 discussed how to run a society using operant conditioning)
# Social Learning Theory (Albert Bandura)
- Observational Learning: learning based on the observation and imitation of other people's behavior 
	- Modeling: demonstrating a behavior that you saw someone else engage in
	- Did study of aggression against a "Bobo Doll." Children watched a film of an adult beating up or playing nicely with a doll. Afterwards, they were twice as likely to act violently
	- Prosocial: behavior that benefits others
	- Vicarious Conditioning: Learning the consequences/ rewards of an action by watching others be punished or rewarded for the same action
	-
