You can either know:
1. Relations of Ideas: things that can be known by just reasoning through them (a priori)
2. Matters of Fact: things that require observations and experimentation for us to know (a posteriori)
	- Our reasoning concerning matters of fact appears to be founded on the relation of cause and effect
		Note: All we are able to observe is a constant conjunction of events and we can never directly observe that one event causes another
- Inductive Reasoning: drawing inferences from observations that extend beyond the observations (all swans are white)
	 - Problem of Induction: challenge of trying to establish why inferences are justified.
	 - Counter-Inductive Inference: says the future will be dissimilar from the past (shows that a self-justifying rule can't be trusted implicitly)
- Deductive Inference: drawing conclusions that can't possibly be false if premises are true (all swans are animals)
# Hypothesizing
- Quine-Duhem Thesis: It's impossible to directly test any individual empirical hypothesis in isolation 
	- Primary Hypothesis: what we'd normally think of as the hypothesis (planet equation)
	- Auxiliary Hypothesis: all of the things we assume (ie. no smudge on telescope, eyes work...)
	If conclusion turns out to be false (we can't find planet), either the primary hypothesis is wrong or one of the many auxiliary hypotheses is wrong 
- Undeteremination of Theory by Data: science is really hard and requires creativity not just trial and error
# Values in Science
- Epistemic Values: relevant for acquiring knowledge/ arriving at the truth (ie. honesty)
- Non-Epistemic Values: all other types of values (ie. caring about your appearance)
- Inductive Risk: risk associated with making an incorrect judgement about the acceptance/rejection of an inductive hypothesis 
	- You might accept a false hypothesis
	- Or fail to accept a true hypothesis
	These 2 cases show that false positives and false negatives can have different levels of consequences. 
	- P-values (statistical significance values): 
		1. Lower P values imply more false positives
		2. Higher P values imply more false negatives
	- Fields where it's harder to test hypotheses have lower P values
	- Threshold/ Linear Extrapolation: only consider tests above a threshold or above a certain line
	- Choice of how to separate data sets (can lead to more false negatives or positives)
