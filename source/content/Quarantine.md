Separating someone who might be sick from coming into contact with others
- Isolation: like quarantine but for those $known$ to be sick (same countermeasure but triggered differently)
- Cordon Sanitaire: area from which movement is restricted for the purposes of controlling infection
- Isolation Model: people in I are isolated at rate `dI`. People leave isolation at rate `T` and are no longer infectious ![[Screenshot 2025-11-04 at 2.05.23 PM.png]]![[Screenshot 2025-11-04 at 2.05.41 PM.png]]
