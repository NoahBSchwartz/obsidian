The study of biological and chemical changes that impact behavior and cognition
# History
- Trepanation: ancient practice of drilling holes in skull to release evil spirits (sometimes it would even work to release pressure from tumors but usually not)
- Phrenology: by the 1800's, the first inklings of neuroscience evolved. They believed that bumps on the skull revealed mental skills and character traits
# Organization of the Nervous System
- #### Central Nervous System (CNS): The Brain and Spinal Cord
	- Responsibilities include receiving, processing, and responding to sensory information
- #### Peripheral Nervous System (PNS): Neural fibers outside the brain and spinal cord (sensory and motor neurons)
	- Somatic Nervous System: The sensory and motor neurons specifically involved in the ***voluntary*** control of muscle groups 
	- Autonomic Nervous System: Control of glands and internal organs that are ***involuntary***
		- Sympathetic Nervous System: Alarm or arousal system of the ANS (things like release of epinephrine/adrenaline from adrenal glands). Controls fighting, fleeing, feeding, fornicating
		- Parasympathetic Nervous System: Opposite of the Sympathetic Nervous System. Forces you to rest and digest (conserve and prepare)
