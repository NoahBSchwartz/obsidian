# Las Cortes Generales (Spanish Parliament)
Unlike the US they have an asymmetrical parliament
Majoritarianism: usually there's a single-party government
1. The Congress of Deputies (lower house): Handles election of the prime minister, oversight of the government, and formulation of policy at the national level 
	- Composed of 350 members: represent 50 Spanish provinces and 2 autonomous cities, serve 4 years
	- Majority (176!): If a party doesn't get a majority in congress, they need the support of other political forces
		(Minority Governments gain power by trying to gain support of other groups)
2. The Senate (upper house): Plays a secondary and subordinate role in the legislative process (not super useful)
	- Composed of 265 members: 208 elected by popular vote, 57 appointed by regional legislators, serve 4 yrs
		Most are directly elected by the people, each province elects 4 senators, and islands are different
3. Prime Minister
	Plays role in domestic and foreign policy
	- Powers
		- Writes laws that parliament has to vote on
		- Is allowed to call for early election if he doesn't have enough support in parliament
	- Election Process:
		1. The King: nominates prime minister
		2. The House (congress): If prime minister is elected by single majority then he needs overall majority to pass laws
		4. If no candidate found then the house gets dissolved
	- Motion of Censure: it's possible to replace the prime minister
		- Proposed by 1/10 of the Members of Congress and must include another candidate
		- Very Stable: The prime minister can only be replaced with a good alternative (very very hard)
Notes: Some fragmentation until 2015, 2 largest parties had held over 80% of seats in Congress until 2015, very high level of cabinet stability
