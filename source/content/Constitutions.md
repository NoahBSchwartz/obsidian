Constitution = document written down with constituent power and rigid (this comes from social contract of Modern Natural Law)
# Background
- Modern Natural Law was very important to the formulation of constitutions
	1. The contemporary age emerged out of revolution at the end of the 18th century
	2. Modern Constitutionalism: emerged in France and USA (not England!)
		- The declaration of rights of citizens and men was one of the first constitutions in 1791
		- 776 state constitutions were popping up in the USA
- Countries 
	- England: was different, they didn't elaborate a new constitution. There is not a written constitution in England!!
		- They felt they had a historical constitution in the form of Magna Carta, Bill of Rights, Pactum Subjectonis, Common Law
	- France: National Sovereignty, Separation of Powers (legislative on top), Principle of Legality. Individual Rights
		- Believe in Monarchical Order (first constitution established this)
	- USA
		1. America was very angry because "no taxation w/o representation" (stamp act raised taxes, tea act pushed US citizens over the edge). 
			- Double Basis: 
				1. Traditional: They said they were Englishmen so deserved rights under the ancient English constitution (common law)
				2. New: They said they were humans so deserved natural rights (under Modern Natural Law)
			- The Declaratory Act: British parliament defended their authority to impose laws in the American Colonies
		2. American Revolution Brewing 
			- They thought Modern Natural Law had the right to overthrow dictatorship
			- James Otis: the superiority of the constitution (contractualism = people must consent)
		3. Declaration of Independence written: defends the idea of contractualism (against tyrannical parliament but they still like England)
# Modern Constitutionalism
### USA
Established a republic (not monarchical order). Most importantly it took power away from branches! PRIMACY OF THE CONSTITUTION
1. Articles of Confederation (1781): 1st American constitution, creates house of delegates 
2. 1787 convention: changed AOC because they needed much stronger national gov (Federalism! = Created 2 Written Constitutions w National Government stronger)
	1. Constitution of Each State (daily life interests like education, religion...)
	2. National Constitution (big picture like army, economy...): popular sovereignty (remove king, remove parliamentary sovereignty)
		- Political power is in hands of >21 year old men who pay taxes
		- Declare rights as a human (not creating rights)
	Note: this was all about setting up Limited Government (limited by people)! Different from England 
3. System Setup (check and balances)
	- Bicameralism: House of Reps guarantees unity of nation, Senate guarantees autonomy of each state 
		- Note: 2 year terms for HoR and 6 year for Senate (this is a check and balance)
	- Presidential Regime: people elect head of gov/state, remove power from parliament (England gives parliament power to elect head of state)
		- President has power of veto (check parliament)
	- Judicial Power: can now interpret the law with constitutional court w judicial review (vs. Europe was just carrying it out, they couldn't be a democracy until constitutional court)
### European Legal System
- European Legal System: Classical Libearalism (Modern Natural Law) 1791=1812 Constituent Power (Rigid)
	Principles
	1. Principle of Legality: primacy of the written law 
	2. Principle of Separation of Powers (Montisque): 
		- Parliament is on top 
			- 1791-1795 Unicameralism: more radical approach bc every class represented in one single chamber (all men can vote)
			- 1795 Bicameralism: 2 chambers, senate is superior (senators serve for lifetime)
		- Executive
		- Judicial: jurisprudence was eradicated, illegitimacy of judicial lawmaking 
	3. National Sovereignty: state is represented in nation 
	4. Individual Rights: they recognize individual rights
		- private property, security, liberty, freedom of speech, freedom of press
	Features
	- Every single person subject to one source of law (the constitution)
	- Tried to reduce sources of law from plurality of modern age to unity that they tried to establish
	Countries
	- Spanish Consitution (1812-1889): 1 century after european code
		- Main Difference: not the supreme law of the land, the customs in specific regions were above it (and it was just seen as supplementary)
	- French Constitution (1814): 
	- English Legal Model: common law
		- No codification at all
		- German Legal Model: they think law is an alive reality that's always changing, if you put things into a code then dead people will have more power than alive people, law must always be chaning
- Moderate Liberal Constitutionalism (1830-1914
	- Reject Modern Law in favor of Doctrinary Liberalism because they believe first french state established by revolutionaries was absolute 
	- Constitution: only recognized orgnization of political system (flexible) able to be changed by legislative power
	- Recovered the monarchy
	- Bicameralism: senators have lifetime position, the other chamber is elected by 5% of population 
	- Constitution lost power
	- Census Suffrage (restrict right to vote): if you have time to have enlightened thoughts you can vote, if you have to work super hard than you have no time to vote
	- State Sovereignty (parliament limited by executive and monarchy)

# Questions for Essay 4
1. Compare US american constitutionalism with 1st constitutional model (classical liberal constitution)
2. Understand the similarities and differences between european model and US
	- US
		- The judges in the US can interpret and make law, european model has judges that can only apply the law
		- Europe has rigid, Moderate Liberal State has flexible (elaborated by legistlative power, not constituent power) makes it easy to change articles of constitution
	- Europe
		- National soveriengty in European model vs State Soveriengty in Moderate Liberal State model (soverienty not in hands of nation because they think that leads to absolutism so they think soveriengty should be objective not subjective) The State = legistlative, executive, monarch 
		- Europe had everything about the legislator
		- Europe believed completely in the written law
			- Europe had to change the law with the codification process
		- Spain is not going to recognize religious freedom
