- Continuity vs Discontinuity
	- Continuity Theory: Human Development is a gradual, continuous process
	- Discontinuity Theory: development occurs in a series of distinct stages
- Prenatal Development
	- Neurogenesis: proliferation of neurons through cell division, mostly from conception to 20 weeks
	- In 12 to 14-week-old embryo, nerve cells proliferate at rate of 15 million or more per hour
- Cognitive Development
	- Jean Piaget: discontinuity theorist. He did testing of children as a job before psychology. He noticed that kids of certain age groups were getting certain types of questions wrong
		- Theorized that children are born with schemas (strategies for interacting with environment
		- Schemas changes as child explores the world
			- Assimilation: bringing in information from the environment
			- Accommodation: schema changes to incorporate new information
	- Stages of Cognitive Development
		1. Sensorimotor Stage (birth-2 years): Schematic stage based on sensory impressions and motor activities
		2. Preoperational Stage (2-6 years): Prelogical stage based on language mastery
			- Object Permanence: cornerstone of stage, awareness that objects exist even when not perceived 
			- Egocentrism: Thinking that is centered exclusively around the self
		3. Concrete Operational Stage (6-11 years): ability to think logically about concrete events
			- Operations: manipulation of logic
			- Conservation Tasks: Assess understanding that substances remain the same even after physical transformation 
				- Conservation of volume, liquids, matter, and area
		4. Formal Operational Stage (11 years - adulthood)
			- Schema characterized by elaborate logic and hypothetical thinking
	  - Critiques
		  - Doesn't account for adulthood development
		  - Neglects individual differences
		  - Relied on observational method to make theory (not experimental)
		  - Neglected education, gender, culture, and socioeconomic status 
  - Lev Vygotsky: Sociocultural theory
	  - Cognitive development is guided by adults interacting with children
	  - Cultural context determines how, where, and when interactions happen 
	  - Zone of Proximal Development: range of abilities that an individual can perform with assistance but cannot yet perform independently 
# Adolescence
Transitional period from puberty to independent adulthood (teen years in industrialized countries)
- Parent vs peer interactions: parents often have more influence in major decisions; peers are more influential with minor decisions
- Development of Moral Reasoning (Lawrence Kohlberg): he thought there was a dramatic shift in moral reasoning during adolescence. He would give people different stories and ask them to judge the characters as a test for this 
	1. Preconventional Level: primitive morality is based on avoiding punishment and gaining reward (things like following the law)
	2. Conventional Level: morality based on avoiding social dishonor and gaining approval (things like not bullying someone)
	3. Postconventional Level: morality based on a belief in social rights and personal ethics (people like MLK)
	- Critique: Kohlberg wasn't really studying moral behavior but was just looking at opinions and attitudes (you can't see how people will actually act just by asking them to state their opinions)
		- The "morally right thing" is based on cultural bias
		- Carol Gilligan: pointed out gender bias (because women are more likely to consult with each other before making a moral decision)
# Adulthood
- Psychosocial Development: Erik Erikson rejected the limitations of just looking at childhood and developed a theory for an entire life. Laid out certain tasks you must complete for each stage of development
	1. Task of Infancy
		- 1 year: Basic Trust vs Mistrust (should caregivers be relied on)
		- 2 years: Autonomy vs Shame and Doubt (becoming toilet trained makes kids feel independent and in control)
	2. Task of Childhood
		- 3-5 years: Initiative vs Guilt (be independent but think about actions)
		- 6 years-puberty: Industry vs Inferiority (feel like you can make some difference in your life)
	3. Task of Adolescence
		- Puberty-20 years: Identity vs Role Confusion
			- Identity Crisis
			- Erikson lived this identity crisis because he found out his father wasn't his true dad
	4. Task of Adulthood
		- 20-40 years: Intimacy vs Isolation (how you present yourself, how you feel about yourself, dealing with loneliness)
		- 40-65 years: Generativity vs Stagnation (doing things vs slowing down)
		- 66 years and up: Ego Integrity vs Despair (feeling good about yourself and your life vs depression)
		-
