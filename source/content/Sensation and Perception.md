# Sensation 
- Process by which nervous system and sensory receptors receive information from outside world 
	- Input comes from sensory modality: olfaction (smell), audition (hearing), gustation (taste), vision, and touch 
	- Phantom Limb Phenomenon: tendency to experience sensation in amputated limb
# Perception
- Adaptive process of organizing and identifying sensory information. Three Stages of Perception:
	1. Selective Attention (regulate all of info coming in)
	2. Organization (making sense of the information)
	3. Interpretation (drawing conclusions from the information)
- Perceptual Organization: The contribution of Gestalt Psychology
	- Figure-Ground Relationships: organization of visual field into figures that stand out from the background (allows you to see depth)
	- Laws of Organization (Max Wertheimer)
		1. Proximity: tendency to group figures that are physically close together 
		2. Similarity: tendency to group figures that are physically similar
		3. Closure: tendency to complete incomplete figures (like looking at constellations)
		4. Continuity: tendency to perceive smooth continuous directions rather than discontinuous patterns
- Perceptual Set: Mental context or predisposition that influences perception (like when you see a scary movie and then everything sounds scary)
	- Perceptual Schema: facial recognition is attuned to the eyes and the mouth
	- Illusions disrupt perceptual set
