# Stages of Economic Integration
1. Free Trade Agreement (FTA): Zero tariffs between member countries and reduced non-tariff barriers (regulations, rules of origin, quotas)
2. Customs Union: FTA + common external tariff
3. Common Market: CU + free movement of goods, capital and labor, some policy harmonization
4. Economic Union: CM + common economic policies and institutions
	- When countries exchange national currency for euro 
		1. They delegate responsibility for monetary policy to the European Central Bank (ECB)
		2. They must coordinate w Council of Ministers for Economic and Financial Affairs
Note: out of 27 countries 7 don't use the euro but will be required if they meet the criteria (Denmark negotiated to not have to, UK never did, Sweden prob never will)
- Convergence Criteria:
	- Price stability (inflation is under control), Sustainable finance (limit gov borrowing and debt), Exchange Rate Stability (participate in exchange rate mechanism for >2 yrs), Long Term Interest Rates (to assess whether the country achieved the other criteria)
	- Ensure that national central bank is independent (and will always be independent)

# EMU
European Monetary Union
- Properties of EMU
	- Puts limits on government debt and deficit
	- Common currency (euro)
	- Independent monetary policy run by the European Central Bank
- Main Actors
	- The European Council: sets the main policy
	- The Council of Ministers: decides whether Member State may adopt the euro
		- The Stability and Growth Pact: ensures sustainable public finances by keeping gov deficits below 3% of GDP and gov debt below 60% of GDP
	- The "Eurogroup": coordinates policies of common interests Member States
	- Member States: get to set their national budgets within agreed limits for deficit and debt
	- European Commission: monitors countries' performance and compliance
		- Broad Economic Policy Guidelines: adopted by the EU Council (recommended by commission), updated annually, guidelines for EU and each member state to promote stability
			- Sets the stage of the European Semester: by laying out National Reform Programmes and Country Specific Recommendations
	- European Central Bank: sets monetary policy for price stability (2% inflation target)
	- European Parliament: formulates legislation (means economic policy is democratic)
- European Semester: annual cycle for economic policy coordination at EU level (lets members make new plans each November)
	- Processes that work each semester: Stability and Growth Pact,  Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure (is designed in case of risky developments but never needed, Broad Economic Policy Guidelines
- The Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance (TSCG): intergovernmental treaty (not part of EU's legal framework) that responded to euro area crisis
	- Created Fiscal Compact: said countries need to have a balanced budget
1. Pros: 
	- Greater macroeconomic stability and resilience and more efficient functioning of a single market (price stability, exchange rate stability, low interest rates, increased investment and trade)
	- Countries need to consolidate their public finance to join EU)
	- Eliminates exchange rate fluctuation and transaction costs (makes market more efficient)
2. Cons: 
	- Biggest Drawback: countries lose control over their monetary policy (which become managed by a central bank not tailored to specific countries)
	- Asymmetric Shocks: changes in economic conditions that affect countries or regions differently 
- Misc Facts: there is international picture on 1 side of Euro and picture from country of origin on other side
