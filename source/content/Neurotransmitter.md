The chemicals stored in the terminal buttons, released when a certain threshold is hit. Transmits information to other neurons
# Types:
- Acetylcholine: involved in memory, learning, attention, arousal and involuntary muscle movement
- Gamma Aminobutyric Acid (GABA): like the brake pedal of the nervous system, stops neurons from firing
- Glutamate: the accelerator of the system, makes neurons fire a lot (ie. anxiety)
- Norepinephrine: stimulant, involved in attention (ie. caffeine, amphetamines)
- Oxytocin: responsible for love and bonding 
- Dopamine: affects sleep, mood, attention, learning, extroversion (very involved schizophrenia)
- Serotonin: involved in sleep, attention, mood (very involved in depression because serotonin gets sucked back in before it can make someone happy) 
- Substance P: transmitter abundant in sensory tracts which spreads pain information to the brain
