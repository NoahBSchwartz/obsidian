When you feel a little sick and then super sick and then a little sick (non-uniform), there is actually changes in virus concentration going on
- Within-host dynamics (Viral Kinetics): the viral load and symptoms can match up differently
	 Varies by pathogen, person to person, immunological strength. We need to find how viral load is related to infectiousness even w all this!!
	1. With no viral load you have to have 0 infectiousness. At some viral load infectiousness has to saturate (100% infectious)![[Screenshot 2025-11-04 at 2.40.54 PM.png]]
Important because it changes how you communicate to ppl (are they infectious before or after symptoms)
