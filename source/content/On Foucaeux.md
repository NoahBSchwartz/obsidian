Post modernism is simply the observation, comment on, and reverse of everything that came before. It's just language eating its own tail. But just like how philosophy originated from simple thought, can't observing the rules of this conglomerate generate entirely novel ideas?

Apply this to LLM's. They're simply trained on the combination of all data and one day they'll run out of data. They'll turn to generating their own data, but just how the post-modernist eating of its own tail is useless, this will be useless too. Won't it be better then to act as a philosopher in this sludge, observing the underlying rules, to break from them. Figuring out the patterns to reverse them into something truly novel.

Post-modernism cycles can generate ideas on its own by reversing and combining and connecting but they'll be less meaningful than going below the mix to see the structure beneath it. While Foucaux seems to understand this, his entire essay is dedicated to showing us that there is a structure beneath the language, beneath the training data that we take for granted. It will take a non-human intelligence to actually unearth the specifics of the broad structure that he sees so clearly.
