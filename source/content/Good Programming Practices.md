# Problem Solving Before Coding
1. Read through entire Github requirements before starting on project
2. Don't just start coding, make an actual plan and think through the problem
3. Write down a list of inputs and outputs
4. Write down an algorithm in simple words that you will follow 
# Coding Process
1. Make header file
2. Make constructor function
3. Make display function 
4. Make insert function
5. Make search function 
# Tips
- Make your own smaller implementation of a larger program (ie. instead of running a program on a book run it on a paragraph first)
