1. Hypothetico-Deductive Theory: A piece of evidence confirms a hypothesis if the hypothesis entails the evidence 
	- Debunked because you can't use one piece of evidence to prove an entire hypothesis
- Decisions Under Ignorance: Sometimes we simply don't have probabilities available to use
	- Principle of Indifference: Roughly, the principle says that if there are n possible outcomes with unknown probabilities, each outcome should be assigned a probability 1/n. (bad because sometimes the answer you get from principle won't agree (like length vs area))
	- Dominance Reasoning:
		- Strongly Dominates: If one act dominates another in all states, you should pick it (very limited number of scenarios)
		- Weakly Dominates: If one act dominates another in some states, you should pick it (as long as picking the first act won't leave you worse off in any states)
		Note: Any strongly dominating act is also weakly dominating
	- MaxiMin: pessimistic rule, pick the best worst case scenario
	- MaxiMax: optimistic rule, pick the best best case scenario
	- Hurwicz Criterion: given an optimism index, the rule generates a score (the more optimistic, the more it weights the max. The less optimistic the more it weighs the min)![[Screenshot 2024-04-15 at 12.57.05 PM.png]]
	- MiniMax Regret: minimize the regret you might feel in a certain situation Choose A4:  ![[Screenshot 2024-04-17 at 1.05.17 PM.png]]
