- Identifying Arguments
	1. Standard Argument Form: set of declarative sentences supporting conclusion
		- premises: declarative sentences that are either true or false
			- premise/conclusion indicator: words like therefore, so... 
	2. Explanations: why the conclusion is true, rather than a reason for thinking that the conclusion is  true 
- Complex Arguments
	1. Main Conclusion: found by looking at which point all premises point to
	2. Intermediate Conclusion: look at which point needs to be proven before main conclusion is proven
		- Subargument: provides indirect support for main conclusion by supporting one of its premises
	- To put complex arguments into standard form, use paraphrasing
		- Supply the missing premises needed to make argument strong
			- principle of charity: when reconstructing argument try to make it as strong as possible (ie. adding premises to an argument)
				- Making these premises weak (some cats are nice) is more charitable because they're easier to prove
- Deductive vs Inductive: absolutely true vs probably true
	- Defeasible Arguments: by adding more info, inductive argument fails
	- Inductive Arguments can be weak or strong (either provides good evidence for conclusion or doesn't)
	- Universal Generalization: leads to deductive arguments (universal: all birds can fly-> deductive) (most birds can fly-> inductive)
		Note: Absolute Truth is rooted in the real world, claims we make are just attempts to get our version of truth to line up with the world
- Testing Arguments: A strong argument has good premises and a good inference to get to conclusion 
	- Valid Argument: conclusion can't be false assuming premises are true
		(Note: premises can be false but IF they were true, conclusion is true)
		- Informal Test of Validity: imagine a world...
	- Invalid Argument: possible for the premise to be true and yet the conclusion false
		- Counterexample: description of scenario where premises of argument are all true while conclusion of argument is false
	- Sound Argument (soundness): valid argument w/ all true premises 
- Normative vs Descriptive: whether something ought to be true vs what is actually true
	- The Is-Ought Gap: statements about what ought to be the case can never be derived from statements about what is the case
		ie. If the conclusion has "should" in it, the premise must also
- Make Arguments More Convincing
	- Sometimes people use certain phrases to cut an argument short:
		1. Assuring: saying there are further reasons but not giving them
		2. Guarding: weakening your own claims so that it's harder to show it's false
			- A weak claim (some cats are nice) is much easier to prove than a strong one (all cats are nice)
		3. Discounting: anticipating objections as a way of dismissing them
			- This can be done w/ "A but B." ie. the car was fancy but old
	- Descriptive vs Evaluative language: describing something neutrally vs passing judgement
		Ex. Tall is descriptive, Good is evaluative (aka normative)
		- Presupposition: injecting a second hidden assertion into a conversation (ie. "Even Jane could pass.")
		- Non-Rational Persuasion: evaluative language isn't rational
