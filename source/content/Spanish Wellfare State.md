4 Pillars:
1. Bismarckian-inspired policies: focus on income $maintenance$ (ie. pensions, unemployment benefits)
	- Pensions: usually retire around 65 (if you've contributed enough) or 66 years (if haven't contributed enough)
		- Contribution base: Amount depends on their salary in work, how many years they paid social security, type of retirement (ordinary/early/deferred)
		- Non-Contributory Pension: people that haven't paid enough in social security get this pension
	- History 
		- 2011 Pension Reform: normal retirement age went from 65 to 67, contribution period extended, little access to early retirement
		- 2013 Pension Reform: rises in pensions no longer automatic, but pension payments will rise by a minimum of 0.25 percent every year (good)
		- 2021 Laws (guarantee purchasing power): Government and social partners signed an agreement for pension reform (each year pensions will be increased w annual inflation)
	Note: this is a top heavy system, young workers are decreasing and old workers are increasing! (will account for 14-17 percent of Spainâ€™s public expenditure by 2050 compared with 9 percent in 2010)
2. Social-democratic policies: prioritize health care and education
3. Liberal policies: centered around minimum-income (ie. social inclusion programs
4. Dependency Law (2007): caregiving exclusively by the family has become unsustainable (improved Long Term Care (LTC) system)
	- Goal: guarantee public support across Autonomous communities for people w disabilities/age/illness
	- Process: depends on level of dependency, if gov can't offer caregiver than they must give the family money (this is too common, bad)
		- Many people are assessed as eligible for benefits but don't receive them
	- "Dependency Limbo": nearly 200000 people pending to recieve aid (45% of people waiting have severe dependency)
The State, Market, Families (provide economic cushion), and Third Sector all play a big role in wellfare
# Timeline
The welfare state has been decentralized over past 30 yrs (Autonomous Communities take care of it)
- Timeline: Welfare state expanded from 80s-90s, Economic crisis occurred in 90s, Now political parties can choose what to do (but mostly limit welfare to control cost)
# Sectors
1. Education (Autonomous Community Power): mandatory and free for 6-16, easy access to universities but could be low quality, charter system is increasing private education, spending increasing 
2. Healthcare: one of best in world until recently, around 9% GDP spent on healthcare, universal coverage (financed from taxes)
	- National Health System Interterritorial Council: manages whole system (but still decentralized to autonomous communities)
	- Risks: 1 in 6 people are obese, alcohol contributed to premature death, air pollution is bad
	- Issues: 
		1. The less healthy that people are the more expensive it is for society w universal health care
		2. Waiting times are long (so people are getting privatized insurance)
		3. Limited resources in crisis (ie. covid)
