Humanism developed in 16th century which led to absolutism (administrative monarchies) from 17th-18th century. Modern Natural Law Emerged in 17th century under these conditions to question the social, political, and divine order 
1. Hugo Grotius (Mos Geometricus): OG theory! Used Mathematics and Natural Science to discover and establish the law according to human nature not religion (he made concrete theorems). AKA he studied Natural Law (unwritten laws) to establish Positive Law (written down)!
	1. Nature: Studied human nature of *individuals*
	2. Secularism: Law and religion should be separate 
	3. Rational: The supreme power is not god. The supreme power is reason 
	Previously natural law had been seen as coming from god (so king needed divine power). But with reason god was not needed, the law could be discovered
2. The theory was twisted: people said Monarch has the supreme "reason" to establish laws in specific territory
3. Enlightenment 18th Century: thought about happiness and power
	- Enlightened Despotism: Monarchs kept all power but implemented some enlightened ideas (better living conditions) "Everything for the people nothing by the people"
		- Same Status Quo: Legal Absolutism = production is in hands of monarch (law = will of monarch), Judicial Absolutism = the judges are agents of the monarch
4. Differences between thinkers: Thinkers used the same idea (Naturalism) to defend absolutism or to defend Liberalism
	- Baseline Ideas: Social Contract (order comes from a natural agreement between people). Thus, all individuals make a pact which limits their own freedom when they live in society
		- Absolutism
			- Hobbs: the king gets the power of the social contract
		- Liberalism
			- Locke: Parliament gets the power 
			- Russo: the people get the power
			Liberal Thought
			- Theory of Subjective Rights: by virtue of being human we have certain rights (which legal system didn't recognize at the time)
			- Voluntarism: humans voluntarily give up rights to be in society
			- Scientification: Enlightened Codes (ie. write down and organize laws)
