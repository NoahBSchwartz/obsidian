- Chemicals that activate neural activity. They can come from your brain, body, or outside your body
- Different from neurotransmitters because they work on the brain as a whole, rather than just individual neurons by altering the sensitivity of neurons to neurotransmitters and affect broader networks of neuronal activity
# Types:
- Endogenous (internal)
	- Opioid Peptides: pain killers inside your body (kind of like natural tylenol). Released when you're in the zone, pushing yourself (like a runners high). They produce analgesic effects by blocking the release of substance P (see [[Neurotransmitter]])
		- Candace Pert: discovered opiate receptors in the brain which led scientists to understand the brains internal pain management system
	- Antagonists: Drugs that inhibit the actions of neurotransmitters
	- Enkephalins, Beta-Endorphins, Dynorphins all help with pain
		- Sometimes, beta-endorphins are released when you're in psychological pain. If the grieving process runs too long, they begin to cause problems and lower the immune system
- Exogenous (external): things like opioids and cocaine
	- If you take too much of these, your internal opioid peptides will diminish or shut down
# Systems:
- Endocrine System: works with nervous system to influence your mental activity and behavior through the use of hormones (released from glands)
	- Hormones: chemicals released into the bloodstream by endocrine glands that trigger some action to take place (like growth hormones, sex hormones, birth hormones)
