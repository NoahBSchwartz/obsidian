Tables define properties for sentences, sentence sets, arguments
- Tautology: a sentence that's true on every row of the truth table
- Contradiction: a sentence that's false on every row of truth table
- Contingent: neither a tautology nor a contradiction
- Logically Equivalent: if 2 sentences have the same truth value on every row of the truth table
	- Ex. `¬(A ∧ B) <-> ¬A ∨ ¬B` (DeMorgans)
	- Ex. `A ⊃ B <-> A ∨ B`
