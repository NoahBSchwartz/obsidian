# Parties Involved
Domestic (national) political parties compete for seats in the European Parliament
1. Political Groups: in the European Parliament are coalitions of MEPs elected in the EP from different member states
	- Form around ideology instead of nationality (ie. European People's Party)
	- Cleavages: right/left, support/opposition to further European integration
		- The Left GUE/NGL (‘Confederal Group United Left’ / ‘Nordic Green Left’): (leftist and (former) communist parties
		- Socialists and Democrats: center-left socialist and social-democratic parties
		- Greens/EFA (European Free Alliance): Environmentalist and regionalist parties (usually leftist)
		- Renew Europe: Liberal parties of the political center
		- European People’s Party: Christian-democratic parties and center-right parties
		- European Conservatives and Reformists: Eurosceptical parties of the right
		- Patriots for Europe: Right-wing populist and eurosceptic
		- Europe of Sovereign Nations: Far-right political group 32
		- Non-inscribed: individual MEPs who have not joined any political group
2. European political parties: (groups of national political parties) operate outside of the EP (formed based on shared policy positions on issues)
	Europarties = transnational parties (more and more independent from political groups)
	- Ex. European People’s Party (EPP) and Party of European Socialists (PES)
	- Regulation (2014): set regulations governing political parties at European level and the rules regarding their funding
	- Criteria: must have legal personality in the Member State in which its seat is located 
		Either: be represented in at least one quarter of Member States
		OR its member parties have received, in at least one quarter of the Member States, at least three per cent of the votes cast
3. Interest Groups (ie. European trade federations, National business associations... )
	- ==Interest representation in EU is largely pluralist==
	- Types of lobbying strategies:
		1. Inside Lobbying: try to influence policy-making from within, by becoming part of deliberations or policies
		2. Outside Lobbying: try to put pressure on policy makers from the outside, by organizing public protests and involving the media
	- Impacts: 
		- Makes EU 'multi-level': incorporates national, local, state, company interests (which leads to pluralism vs corporatism)
