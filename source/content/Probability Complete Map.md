1. Normal/Gaussian Distribution: add up a bunch of (independent!) random variable copies together 
2. Log-Normal Distribution: multiply together a bunch of independent random variables
	- This is because we can take a series of multiplications and make them into sums by taking the log of everything
3. Power Law Distribution: when things grow by random percentages at each time step
4. Binomial Distribution:
