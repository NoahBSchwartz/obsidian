There was a less polarized society and learned lessons from the civil war which made the consolidation of democracy possible in the 70s and 80s but not the 30s
1. Caused by Death of Franco 
2. Lead to 2 autonomous cities and 17 autonomous communities (they don't have constitutions)

# Instruments of Reform 
1. Law for Political Reform (leads to open and free elections)
2. The Moncloa Pacts: signed by political parties (brought social peace but can not be considered a social pact)
	- Moncloa is the district of Madrid where the pact was signed (in the house of the prime minister)
# The Constitution Had to Make Compromises
1. Monarchy vs Republic -> Parliamentary Monarchy: people started out supporting the monarchy but reformers wanted republic so this was the agreement (people elect representatives and those representatives elect prime minister)
2. Unitary vs Decentralized State -> Estado de Las Autonomias: have multiple languages, have multiple autonomous communities, all participating in republic
	- Overtime 17 autonomous communities will gain more and more power (today they cover Education and Healthcare)
3. Catholic Church -> Religious Pluralism: the church will still play an important role in education and a social role but it has far less of a political role and other religions are allowed (but not many compete w church)
4. Duties of Armed Forces: ensure sovereignty and independence of the country, defend constitutional order. Spain joined NATO
	- They had a ton of power under Franco, but now it was lessened considerably which was a very difficult pill to swallow
