- SR (Social Robot) Design = Cyclic Process: Engineering Design Process (Frankenstei/inside-out ie. put different tech together and then think about appearance), User-Centered (outside-in focus on the users first), Participatory (users and stakeholders make decisions in design process) 
	- Design Principles: the whole robot should be coordinated (animal robot doesn't teach math), open-ended design (ie. don't make dog or cat robot make a seal robot), underpromise and overdeliver
- Affordances: features that enable certain actions (ie. you can sit on stairs and chairs bc they both have surfaces) (examples in robots = appearance, skills, etc.)
- Interaction
	1. Timing: turn-taking among interaction partner
	2. Rhythm: synchrony between the interaction partnersâ€™ actions
	3. Spacial Interaction: make sure to follow social distance norms
		- Proxemics: how people take space in relation to others and how it influences interactions (Intimate space, Personal space, Social space, Public space)
			- f-formation (face formation): tool used for group spatial dynamics
				- O-space: space to which participants have equal access
				- P-space: space the group participants occupy
				- R-space: the surrounding space
	4. Non-Verbal Interaction: eye movement, gestures, mimicry, touch, posture
		- Joint-Attention: interaction partners attending to the same object or area at the same time 
		- Gestures: Deictic Gestures = gestures used during joint attention, Iconic = gestures used to illustrate what's being said, Symbolic = gestures w their own meaning (waving), Beat = go along w rhythm of speech
		- Mimicry = unconscious, Imitation = conscious 
		- Functional Touch = ie. robot cleaning wound, Affective = ie. trying to comfort someone
	5. Automated Speech Recognition (Cloud-based/On-board): consists of Voice-Activity Detection, Speech-to-Text, Dialogue Manager (keeps flow of convo), Text-to-Speech
		- Dialogue Manager: Restrictive (order of who speaks is very strict), Event-based (flow can be interrupted by events), Planner-based (consider the actions that need to be taken)
			- Back Channeling: signal that robot is still engaged
		- Text-to-Speech: Concatenative (cut voice into phonemes and glue words together), Parametric (trained model generates acoustic parameters to synthesize text), DNN 
	6. Automatic Emotions: can either be continuous or discrete
