Covers why people of different races are in different classes, and the geographic barriers keeping them there. A lot of economic inequality is driven by segregation
- Apartheid: Political Choices have caused the class distribution that we currently have
	- De Jure: Before the 1970s, there was slavery and voting laws which were intentional forms of segregation 
	- After Civil Rights Movement: neighborhood borders were enforced by banking systems, violence, wealth disparities
		- Certain races weren't allowed to live in certain neighborhoods because of policy (even after Civil Rights!)
	- Defacto: In the 1970s and 80s, racism wasn't the direct cause of economic disparities. Things like economic downturn, labor union policies, and options available to people lead to race disparities without many being aware of it
		- In neighborhoods: norms play a huge part (if you see broken families all around you, you'll probably start a broken family), self-perpetuating cycles (more crime leads to more police leads to less strong families)
- What if Neighborhoods weren't segregated: kids can make connections between class and race which would lead to less inequality when they grow up
