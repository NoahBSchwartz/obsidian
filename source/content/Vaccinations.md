# Background
- Immune systems have an:
	1. Innate (pre-programmed) capability. It's non-specific 
	2. Adaptive (adapting to exposures) capability. It's pathogen-specific
		- Aquire Adaptive Capability over time: Lymphocytes, B-Cells, T-Cells, Antibodies 
- Immune Responses can be:
	1. Humoral: mediated by non-cell macromolecules (ie. antibodies, complement system)
	2. Cellular: mediated by cells (ie. T-Cell response)
	Immunogens generate immune responses
# Vaccination
An attempt to create an adaptive immune response (to prep the adaptive immune system)
1. Inoculation (Old Way): ie. give people cowpox to protect against smallpox 
2. Antigens (Modern Way): generator of antibodies (Vaccinology)
	- Methods: inject weakened virus, inject dead virus, coat nano-particle with antigens, mRNA (give cells instructions to produce antigens)
		- mRNA is the coolest because you can just change your specification on the computer and your body will do it!!
	- Improvements: conjugation (give immune system antigen and smth else to excite it), adjuvants (present antigen in a different way)
# Models of Vaccination
Goals (from best to ok): prevent infection, prevent transmission, prevent progression to disease (keeps you out of hospital)
1. Perfectly Protective Vaccine (anyone in V can't be infected)![[Screenshot 2025-09-16 at 3.11.57 PM.png]]
2. Partially Protective Vaccine:
	- VE: vaccine efficacy = how protective is this in a clinical trial
	- vaccine effectiveness = how protective is this in the field

3. Complex Models: ![[Screenshot 2025-09-30 at 2.44.00 PM.png]]
# Cross Infection Immunity
2 Strain Model: If you're in R1 then you have decreased susceptibility to R2
1. Model this like a leaky vaccine!
2.
