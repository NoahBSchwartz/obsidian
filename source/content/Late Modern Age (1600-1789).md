In 1456 the printing press was invented. The opinions of the individual now mattered! Lead to Legal Humanism
# Philosophy
1. Legal Humanism (Royalists): Criticized how Ius Commune was elaborated in Late Medieval Ages (Mos Italus). Emerged in late 16th century to elevate Royal Law (supported Absolutism but not for divine reasons instead said King is best and smartest)
	- Schools:
		1. School of Glossators (used Glossas): 16th century documents stating correct way to apply Roman law in Medieval reality (general, theoretical)
		2.  School of Commentators: 17th century with more practical elaborations (find solutions for current times)
			- Bartolo de Sasoferrato: "opinion should prevail over everything" (Roman law studied through scholarly opinions)
				- All Arguments supported with "argumentum ab auctoritate" (the truth of the documents)
	- Schools of Thought
		1. Naturalism: every individual is independent and can act on their own
		2. Secularization: religious thought should be separate from law and political system
		3. Rationalism: individual reason is more important than god (humans discover law on their own)
	- Effects: Royal Law is most important, everything else is old! 
		- Pushed society to adopt humanities more and more because: 
			1. If someone didn't know social context that Roman law was written in they couldn't understand it
			2. If someone didn't know Latin then they couldn't understand Roman Law
		- Challenged Divine Power: elevated individualism and reduced importance of Canon Law
		- Reduced Importance of Roman Law (Ius Commune): it must be *interpreted* not worshipped 
# Monarchies 
1. Absolute Monarchy: King amasses all power of Law but doesn't have power like Finances, Police, etc.
2. Administrative Monarchy: alternative to Absolutism where King amasses all power (Law, Finance, Police) and distributes *everything*
	- Centralization and Unification (aka Absolute State): End of Parliament
