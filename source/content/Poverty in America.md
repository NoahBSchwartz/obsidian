A story about the poorest parts of rural America (Blackwell and Appalachia). It describes how the vast majority of impoverished people in America are actually families trying to work and scrape by. Jobs are very scarce and getting into a job is quite dependent on your name and who you know (people hoard jobs like being teachers and only pass it to people in their family)
==Takeaway: hoarding is the big issue behind impoverished towns (hoarding money, status, power along economic, racial, and religious lines)==
Takeaway: in Blackwell economic futures are determined by last name, in Dahlia economic futures are determined by race, in Gray Mountain economic futures are determined by hard work
# Blackwell
- Causes of Intergenerational Poverty: familial ties make it very hard to leave, people can't stand to leave the acceptance of their community, the status quo makes it super hard to switch jobs (holding onto being a coal miner and not moving somewhere)
	- People live on land that their family owns (many times in RVs or mobile homes) so they have almost no money to move
- Rural Poverty vs Urban Poverty
	- Differences: Urban Poverty is anonymous whereas everyone knows your poor rurally, Urban Poor = Democrat and Rural Poor = Republican because they feel like government has left them behind and is incredibly corrupt, crazy wealth hoarding in cities vs not as big a gap in towns
	- Same: poor families tend to have divorced parents
- How are the poor kept poor?
	- The education is so bad that it makes it very hard to rise up
	- Intertwining of political and economic power gives poor people very little power
	- Feudalism: Because of so few jobs poorer people are required to be subservient to their bosses (richer people) to keep their positions
		- Many poor people don't own land themselves which makes them super tied to the land (because selling it would give them no resources)
	- Paternalistic: people in charge of the community can just dole out resources however they want to (so poor people need to be subservient)
		- Many people live outside the formal economy (they barter with their skills and goods instead of actually paying for it)
	- ==Opioid Crisis: Drugs are incredibly prevalent to treat the pain caused from work and got patients hooked without their knowledge (leads to people getting taken to prison, unstable home-life, loss of resources)==
	- Teachers treat all the kids like they have no chance 
- Benefits: family bonds are incredibly strong (making childcare easier, making people pretty happy)
- Timeline:
	1. Blackwell was initially a company town (for coal)
	2. When they left, the company town construct stuck around and the upper class just took the position of the company
	3. Now, people in Blackwell continue to work in coal, education, healthcare, odd jobs (many times paid in goods or trading)
# Dahlia
Also experiencing intergenerational poverty but with the added element of racial and class divides
- How are the poor kept poor?
	1. Schooling is entirely segregated because all the white students go to private schools
	2. Caste system (White people don't want to interact with Black people) makes change very hard
	3. The people with power are trying to prevent change
	4. Poverty goes back many generations to slavery (change seems impossible)
	5. Jobs are passed down from generation to generation (sort of a precapitalist system)
- Differences from Blackwell
	- Not as geographically isolated
	- Dahlia has a very seasonal economy 
- Similarities to Blackwell
	- Everyone has a bad opinion of politics
- Issues Facing Schools: school board is just there to make money and keep power, they won't apply for free school breakfasts, teachers treat all the kids like they have no chance (teachers are white and students are black)
- Political Inequality: People feel that government's default is not working and trying to get anything from it requires owing someone something, voting and campaigning feels like it will threaten the status quo that pays everyone, the threat of violence keeps political participation very low
- Economics: no growth in the community (everyone just holds onto the resources they have)
- Drugs: no treatment for drugs, terrible neighborhoods leads to more drug use, young people get hooked on drugs, law is just who the police feel like arresting (lot of racism)
# Gray Mountain
 - Differences: had a lot more trust in their government and liked the leaders of their community, Dahlia was really all about family name community very antagonistic, Gray Mountain really cared about public funding and really cared about schools
- Similarities: Most people worked in the mill, can’t really outsource that kind of work, a lot of participation in community no divisive organizations, very old town (young people leaving), don’t like outsiders and are self-contained
- Community came together to help out those that weren’t doing well, not a ton of poverty divide, Petersons sort of controlled everything but were quite benevolent
# Conclusion
Poor people are isolated geographically, socially, and economically from the rest of society in the US. The solution to this is increased government intervention.
We looked at how women's compensation makes a situation of impoverished women
We looked at pockets of poverty and how some people amassing power leads to more inequality
