Goal is to get equal representation
- Descriptive Representation: someone is represented by people that share a lot of their same characteristics
- Substantive Representation: characteristics of someone representing you doesn't matter, their policy views being similar is what matters
What makes this difficult?
- Segregation makes it harder to elect racial and ethnic minorities to office (consider if a small Black community doesn't have enough sway to elect a black representative)
- Political Capture: if a group doesn't consist of swing voters then their issues won't be put on top priority for candidates
- More educated voters are more likely to be civically engaged (and they can communicate their opinions easier)
- More marginalized people may be more likely to vote 
- Political Visibility: wealthy people are more visible to politicians
Policy Feedback (new policies create new politics)
- Recipients of benefits are targeted by interest groups and political parties (ie. AARP protecting Social Security, student loan forgiveness
Potential Solutions
- Not that helpful: Mandatory voting, put a cap on how much investment in elections
- Helpful: try to get poor people to be more engaged (write letters, call representative)
# Federal Campaign Finance Law
- Buckley v Valeo: found that money is the equivalent of speech in the context of elections (because all of the ways candidates communicate uses money and people giving money to campaigns is like us helping amplify their voices)
	- Now the only form of corruption that is limited is quid pro quo corruption (I give you money and you enact a policy for me)
- Citizens United v FEC: found that the government cannot restrict independent expenditures by corporations, non-profits, labor unions (this overturned another court case where court ruled that speech could be restricted when it leads to corruption)
- Present Day: The FEC (Federal Election Commission) has 6 commissioners appointed by the president (with no more than 3 democrats and no more than 3 republicans) to monitor corrupt campaign financing. So they are only reactive, rarely ever acts  
- Possible Changes: no limits no disclosure (just do whatever you want), no limits full disclosure (if candidates have to be 100% transparent then we just won't vote for them if they're funding is bad), Supreme Court recognizing "appearance of corruption" as corruption, give FEC a bunch more power to let it actually catch people
# Work, Family, and Past Policy
There's been a large downward pressure on family incomes for earners with a college degree
- Changes in work: less room for upward mobility 
- Changes in families: later average age of marriage, fewer getting married, decline in birth rates
	- People without a college degree are less likely to be married and more likely to get divorced (much more economic instability)
	- Decline of "marriageable men" (ie. men who can get and hold a steady job)
		- Causes: Increased segregation along class lines, Mass incarceration
	- Women in workplace means families are having a harder time balancing work and home responsibilities
	- Family stress has increased and family investment in children has decreased
- Changes in Policy: 
	- Personal Responsibility and Opportunity Act changed the nature of income support for families
	- Earned Income Tax Credit, SNAP, Unemployment Insurance
	- Expanded Child Tax Credit: provided more tax credits for children (new development is not tying it to income)
	-  Rand et al: if real wage growth kept up with GDP then the US would have trillions more wealth but we didn't increase the minimum wage
# Race and Political Inequality
Different races are very divided across party lines
- Political parties just assume they'll get the vote and don't reach out (don't try to cater towards minority). It makes government less responsive to different groups of people
- Occurs because
	1. Intergenerational Wealth is very different between races (and makes them vote differently)
	2. Drug policies effect different races very differently
	3. Education levels varies between different races
	4. Residential Segregation means different races have different policy preferences
	5. Recent immigrants favor immigration policies but are less likely to be voters
- Griffin et al 2017
	Economic inequality is not as much of a factor in political divide as race and education are (which is kinda scary)
	- Capture Thesis: Democrats just assume that Black voters will vote for them and Republicans assume they won't so neither party tries to change policy to cater towards Black voters (White voters get their preferences 38%, Black 31%, Asians 41%)![[Screenshot 2024-11-19 at 2.31.41 PM.png]]
	- Why is economic inequality in the US rising faster than other countries?
		1. We have less of a social safety net
		2. We have very high concentrations of poverty (geographically) but we also have some of the wealthiest people in the world
		3. Much fewer union jobs than we've historically had (no pressures for higher minimum wage)
	- Distribution vs Redistribution: 
		1. Democrats and Republicans disagree on causes of inequality (ie. causes of current distribution)
			- Studies show they can agree on cost of education and on taxes being too high (and give wealthier Americans more taxes)
		2. US doesn't like redistribution because we have to take from one group and give to another
		3. Republicans and Democrats think that federal government, large corporations, state governments are responsible for reducing economic inequality
# Why People Support Democracy
Economics drive the political situation rather than the other way around.
Kriekhaus et al. examines why some literature says people like to be part of democracy because of redistribution, while some say that
1. Political Economy (sociotropic): in a country with high inequality, the majority of the population will support democracy as a potential mechanism for redistribution.
	- citizens seek to maximize their economic self-interest
	- democracy is the political system that best empowers the poor to advance their interest
	- most citizens take into account their personal class position when evaluating democracy
2. Comparative Politics (egocentric): equality generates political disillusion and regime dissatisfaction.
	- citizens evaluate only the past history of their political system
	- assumes that most citizens are relatively poor (so they evaluate national inequality as a bad outcome)
3. Which theory has more support: Comparative Politics has more support (ie. “higher levels of economic inequality reduce support for democracy amongst all social classes”). There’s only a “small prospective egocentric effect, in that the reduction in democratic support in highly unequal countries is slightly less severe amongst the poor, suggesting they believe that democracy might increase future redistribution.”
Egocentric = how it benefits me personally
Sociotropic = how it benefits group

# Future Policy Proposals 
(See National Civic Review) Segregation = opportunity hoarding. Policy Recommendations:
1. Housing Policy:
	- Zoning innovation for health and equity: in the past cities had “economic-based” zoning laws that required minimum lot sizes and the exclusive construction of single-family homes. (created all white neighborhoods). Solutions:
		- Up-zoning: removing restrictions on single-family zoning/minimum lot sizes/parking requirement
		- Inclusionary zoning (IZ): encourages the creation of affordable housing units (to try to desegregate neighborhoods)
		- Accessory dwelling units: Smaller, independent units on the same lot as a single-family home 
		- Zoning for food justice: Localities may ease zoning requirements to incentivize healthy retail stores popping up
	- Displacement and eviction protections to preserve the right to housing: renters are at higher risk for housing-related health problems because they have fewer resources and/ or they face compounding health burdens
		- Right to return or preference policy
2. Education Policy: Change up school districts to integrate different classes of kids
	- School Choice: you're allowed to get into schools in different districts than your own (overcome residential segregation)
	- School Vouchers: people are allowed to use their tax dollars for private schools
3. Transportation Policy: Invest more taxes into mass transit (and use this extra money for income-based fairs)
4. Justice System Policies (See Conviction, Imprisonment, and Lost Earnings Craigie et al): Reduce penalties and reclassify misdemeanors, create pathways away from prosecution, prevent landlords and businesses from discriminating against people with criminal backgrounds, correction authorities should connect people to health-care benefits, policymakers should expand the social safety net
(See Committee on Reimagining the Economy)
1. We don't have great data on a lot of issues related to economic inequality. The report created a new score to measure American well-being in: Economic Security, Economic Opportunity, Health, Political Voice
# Notes on Readings
Social Wellfare Program Reform: Carlson Weimer Haskins talk about things like food stamps
Key driver of intergenerational economic inequality is education 
Transportation is super related to this because if you have economic segregation in housing then transportation can help mitigate this (name policy proposals that can improve access to transportation)
Griffin article had some surprising findings about education (if you want to do education)
Geographic Inequality: Advancing a people first economy can help leverage for things like education 

Narrow down more than just education (maybe do equal access to good schools)
