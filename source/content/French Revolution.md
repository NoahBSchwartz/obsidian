 Change from absolutism to liberalism 
# Background
From the Modern Age until the Liberal Estate was established there was absolutism in Europe 
- France
	- Ancien Regime of France = Old Order (absolutism): King controlled justice finance and police
	- Corporative Society: society divided into orders (catholic clergy, nobility, 3rd estate = 99% of population)
		- 3rd Estate: contains everyone, bourgeoisie and merchants but also farmers and peasants 
			- 3rd Estate had to pay taxes but Nobility did not (privilege given by birth)
	- All sources of law are in hands of royal power 
- Spain
	- Enlightened Despotism: Kings apply enlightened ideas 
# French Revolution
Social Crisis: Bourgeoisie was on top of the 3rd Estate and had ton of economic power but no political power
1. King Louis 16th had huge debt and called parliament to ask for higher taxes (hadn't called parliament in 200 years)
	- The members of parliament were nobility, clergy, bourgeoisie (who represented 99% of people but always outvoted)
	- The freedom of speech and freedom of press were making enlightened ideas flow freely 
2. Bourgeoisie started questioning whole system when Louis called for parliament 
3. Joseph: the 3rd estate should be given full power because it represents French nation

# Post French Revolution Liberal Principles
They still didn't recognize equality, you need to have private property to have political right. Burgeosise wanted to be equal with the King but not the peasants! Everyone submits to one law but the law still maintains inequalities
1. Constituent Power: people are given special power to elaborate constitution
	- Comes from Social Contract -> The liberal estate should be founded on Modern Natural Law
	- Rigid Constitution: difficult to change articles, need constituent power
2. Sovereignty of the Nation (not the population or the monarch)
	- This means it is subjective (the Nation is the general will of the people)
	- The general will of the people has ultimate sovereignty 
3. The absolute power of the written law
	- Countries spoke about legal despotism: Etat de Droit = the submission of the citizens and estate to law
		- Missing a mechanism to control the activity of the estate (missing the constitutional court!)
4. Separation of Powers
	- Montesquieu dreamed up an equilibrium between 3 powers w checks and balances (legislative is top)
		- Legislative (elaborate law to represent nation): Unicameralism (single chamber) or Bicameralism (upper and lower chamber)
		- Judicial (judges are mouth of law/legislator): jurisprudence of concepts = judges can't interpret situations only apply laws 
		- Executive: only for diplomatic and military matters 
5. Recognition and Protection of Individual Rights: there are natural rights from being human 
	- Private Property: everything in society based on property (Burgeosise loved this), no intervention in economic matters
	- Liberty: the right to do anything within the law
	- Security: the law has to be clear and public for all
# Modern Liberal Estate
1. First liberal estate established after French Revolution in 1789
	- France Established 3 Constitutions: 1791, 1793, 1795
2. Modern Liberal Estate vs 1st Liberal Estate 
	- Had a flexible constitution 
	- Law needed a mechanism to control the activity of the estate (the constitutional court!)
