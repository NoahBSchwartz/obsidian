# Brain Structures (General)
- Cerebral Cortex: outer layer of the brain
	- The wrinkles are called convolutions to increase surface area
	- Sulci are small grooves and fissures are large grooves
	- Gyri are the budges between the sulci and fissures 
- Lobes:
	- Frontal Lobe (motor cortex): responsible for personality, higher functions, motor control (much bigger in humans than other animals 4% in mice to 30% in humans)
	- Parietal Lobe (sensory cortex): responsible for perceiving spatial relations and processing sensations
	- Temporal Lobe (auditory cortex): processes sounds
	- Occipital Lobe (visual cortex): processes vision 
	- Prefrontal Cortex: critical for rational thought and controlling social interaction
		- Phineas Gage: a rod went through his skull and changed his personality and self control which helped psychologists learn how important the prefrontal cortex was
- Corpus Callosum: bridge between the left and right hemispheres of the brain 
	- Asymetry of Function: left hemisphere controls right side of body and right controls left
		-  Broca's Area: Language is also only processed in the left hemisphere in Broca's Area (losing this is called aphasia)
		- Wernicke's Area: section in the left hemisphere involve in speech comprehension (different space from Broca's)
	- Split-Brain Research: research where the Corpus Callosum is cut. It helps to control things like epilepsy but leads to strange side effects 
		-  Sperry and Gazzaniga: discovered the corpus callosum's link to epilepsy
# Brain Structures (Specific)
- Hindbrain: most primitive part of the brain (responsible for craving and managing food, sex, motion, water...)
	- Medulla Oblongata: regulates autonomous things like breathing, swallowing, blood circulation, coordination 
	- Cerebellum: regulates coordinated motor activity, language, attention, learning
	- Pons: bridge between higher and lower brain regions, regulates the sleep-wake cycle because it effects consciousness (this is the thing that caffeine effects)
- Midbrain: 
	- Reticular Formation: complex system that maintains vigilance, arousal, and processing of fear and anxiety
	- Ventral Tegmental Area: brain's reward center
- Forebrain (Subcortical): 
	- Limbic System: aggregate of brain structures involved in emotion, motivation and memory
		- Dicenapholon: division of the forebrain
			- Thalamus: relay center for auditory, visual and touch signals
			- Hypothalamus: regulates sexual activity, emotions, food and water intake, reward centers 
				- Olds and Milner figured this out with rats
		- Cerberum: division of the forebrain
			- Hippocampus: involved in the recognition of objects, memory and decision making
			- Amygdala: involved in fear, rage, and aggression
	- Insular Cortex (Insula): involved in self-awareness, emotion, pain, love, addiction, depression
	- Basal Ganglia: control of action selection, voluntary motor movements, procedural learning, cognition and emotion
- Forebrain (Cortical):
	- Occipital Lobe: vision
	- Parietal Lobe: touch, spacial information
	- Temporal Lobe: hearing, memory
	- Frontal Lobe: planning, movement, complex thought
# How We Measure It
- Lesion: surgical or pathological damage in the nervous system
- Stimulation: electrical/ chemical stimulation of the nervous system

- Brain Imaging Techniques
	- Take a "photograph" (static image)
		- Structural Imaging: static representation of brain structure
		- X-Ray
		- Computerized Axial Tomography (CAT/ CT Scan): uses radiation 
		- Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): doesn't use radiation but can give even more detail
	- Take a "video"
		- Functional Imaging: dynamic picture of the brain's chemical and electrical activity
		- Electroencephalogram (EEG): useful for getting images during sleep
		- Positron Emission Topography (PET)
		- Functional MRI (fMRI): gives both structural and activity (and will color them from most to least active)
		- Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS): uses a very fast and powerful magnetic field to momentarily disrupt activity in a specific brain region
# How it Changes
- Plasticity: Because of exposure to certain environments and experiences, the brain can change in three ways:
	1. Neurogenesis: the process of growing new neurons (mostly occurs in hippocampus)
	2. Neural Pruning: changing existing neural connections (neurons that fire together wire together)
	3. Brain Reorganization: entirely new connections develop between nearby brain regions. This new growth is a major factor in recovery from brain injury.
