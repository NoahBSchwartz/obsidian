The graph says that as we get older, the magnitude of our emotions (both negative and positive) decrease. In class, this was presented as a ground truth: as humans gain more and more experience, their willingness to lose decreases and they become more and more risk adverse which means the amount they can feel also dramatically decreases.

Solution 1 (Stoicism): I believe that stoicism fixes this problem, however. The graph relies on the unfounded axiom that negative emotional units are tied exactly with positive ones. But by ensuring that happiness is based primarily on one's outlook of the situation, stoicism provides a cap to how many negative emotions one can feel. It lets the practitioner experience great positivity because they can control how they feel. 

Solution 2 (Buddhism): Scott used the analogy of the giver society in class where all negative emotions were capped so all positive ones were also. This is exactly what buddhism advocates for, though, a total release of any desires which frees the practitioner from feeling any bad emotions but also caps them into a range of feeling contentment alone. This solution argues that emotional units are fleeting and useless to chase. A life full of intense emotional moments will be a less happy life than one filled with low emotional moments but an underlying feeling of intense satisfaction.
