The EU budget is about 1% of the wealth generated by EU economies and 2% of total EU public spending. It finances projects in policy areas where all EU countries agree
1. How it's decided:
	1. European Commission proposes the budget
	2. National governments (through the Council) and the European Parliament then approve the proposal
	3. Multiannual Financial Framework sets annual budgets for a period of 7 years![[Screenshot 2025-04-01 at 1.43.02 PM.png]]
2. How it's funded: Based on percentage of member state's Gross National Income, Small percentage of each Member State’s national VAT rate, Import duties, tax on waste generated by countries
	- Net Contribution: Difference between countries' contributions to EU and how much they get back from EU (small countries get screwed over w large net contribution, big countries are happy w negative net contribution)
	- 1985 The UK Rebate (correction): ad hoc mechanism used to reduce the UK's contribution to the EU budget by refunding 66% of the country's imbalance (all member states had to pay the cost). Has been in place for every year since until Brexit
3. How it's Spent: Full Budget = $1.21 trillion total + $800 billion NGEU (EU's New Generation Recovery Instrument)

# Economics of Council of the EU

	- Competition Policy Council: ensures proper functioning of the internal market
	- Misc Councils: agriculture, education, employment, environment, general affairs, justice and home affairs
- Policy: 
	- Common agriculture policy was most important policy of EU but has declined a lot
	- Economic cohesion has gained importance (as Euro was integrated everywhere)
	- New and Reinforced Policies have gained
		- Digital Europe Programme: funding initiative to try to bring tech to communities (works with Horizon Europe = R & D program, Next Generation EU = recovery and resilience program)
		- Climate Change and the Environment: European Green Deal 2019 = package trying to get to climate neutrality by 2050 (w 55% reduction by 2030), goal is to get to a **green economy**(30% of EU's budget is going to finance green investments but it's hard to ask developing countries to make same effort)
		- Migration, Asylum, Border Management: Migration and Asylum Pact 2024 = trying to make migration and asylum seeking more efficient takes effect 2026 (no single policy for border control but a scheme between countries)
			- Migrant workers get stuck with bad jobs which helps economy (but many are still against them)
		- Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) 1962: support farmers and improve agriculture productivity (and climate change!)
			- First Pillar: Income Support (direct payments to farmers), Market Measures (EU implements policies to deal with bad markets)
			- Second Pillar: Rural Development Programmes (address challenges of rural areas)
			Note: CAP has decreased total budget overtime (even though needs have increased)
	- Cohesion Policy: 1/3 of EU budget (Receive funding from European Structural Investment Fund)
		- European Structural Investment Fund:
			- European Regional Development Fund (ERDF): strengthen cohesion (allocate more funds to less developed regions)

			- Cohesion Fund: funds transport and environmental projects within **low income countries**
			- European Agriculture Fund for Rurual Developemnt (EAFRD)
