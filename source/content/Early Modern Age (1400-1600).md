1. Composite Monarchies (Material Tool): in the 1400s Europe was many different countries all under the jurisdiction of one Spanish king (see [[The Legal System of Medieval Society 476-1492 AD]] for foundation)
	- "Accessory" Union: the territory was annexed to the crown and has same laws as all other territories 
	- Aeque Principaliter Union: territory was annexed to the crown but preserves its same customary law (leads to Legal Pluralism)
		Use Patronage, military presence, royal institution to to maintain their kingdom
2. Jurisdictional Model aka Iurisdictio (Theoretical Tool): the theory that legitimated power. Says that the monarch has divine power
	1. Distributed justice by judgement: the courts can distribute justice 
		- Jurists supported Saint Thomas Aquinas Theory (law = Coactive Force (the punishment) + Directive Force (the desired behavior))
			ie. get tortured if you don't pay taxes
		- Jurists supported Pedro Belluga: sometimes the king has absolute power (and he should know when to apply it because of his Christian education)
	2. Distributed justice by written laws: the king is the only one who can write laws (sovereignty)
	Limits on the King: parliament limited the king's power, pactum subjectionis made monarch respect their kingdom, customary law in regions

# 3 Important Monarchies
1. Hispanic Monarchy: Limited Monarchy (Parliament Important, many limits on power)
	- Features: Composite State (legal pluralism), Pactum Subjectionis (ie. pact between king and kingdom)
	- Absolutism (in 18th century): very easy for king to become absolute Jurisdictional power (Civil Law led to this)
2. Kingdom of England: Limited Monarchy (Parliament Important, many limits on power)
	- Features: Composite State (legal pluralism), Common Law, Magna Carta (Pactum Subjectionis) ie. pact between king and kingdom
3. French Monarchy: Jurisdictional Unit
	- Features: Civil Law (ius commune kept Roman law tradition)
	- Absolutism (in 17th century): very easy for king to become absolute Jurisdictional power (Civil Law led to this)

# Timeline of the Hispanic Monarchy
1. Starting Sources of Law
	- Royal Law: enacted by king or royal institutions (power has to be negotiated w consent of parliament)
	- Ius Propium: the customs/ traditions of past law (written in books called Fueros)
	- Ius Commune: written law (based on) Roman Law
2. The king tried to make Royal Law only source of law (king started going above parliament's head)
3. Ius Propium and Parliament very slowly replaced by Royal Law, Ius Commune still around but king shrunk juries (and controlled jurists, royal law filled all of the holes)
	- Pushback
		- Non-Execution: suspend Royal Law in a certain territory until the king reconsiders (not effective at all)
		- Constitution (Catalan's Attempt): wrote a constitution saying all customary law was final (any royal laws / any judgement from outside Catalan was *null ipso facto*) 
		- Tax Approval: taxes were only paid to the King once he fixed issues (Special Grievance Tribunal)
	- Parliament: became economic institution reducing taxes (but members were tax exempt so they didn't care!), representatives didn't have to consult anyone to make decisions (King payed them all off to make his laws)
	Note: Legal Pluralism still remained through the activity of local judges (they can pick and choose what to do)!



- Fundamental Laws: Jean Bodin was first to put all of the implicit laws and opinions of jurors into fundamental laws
