### Abraham Maslow
- Growth orientation: Seeking satisfaction in life rather than focussing on what is missing. Emphasize how your unique goodness, growth, and self-understanding influence your personality
- Hierarchy of Needs
	1. Biological Needs (food, water)
	2. Safety (shelter, security)
	3. Love/ Belonging 
	4. Esteem/ Accomplishment
	5. Self Actualization (achieving one's potential): They have a surgical precision about their projects. They're obsessive about their work and deeply connected with the universe
### Carl Rogers
- Actualizing Tendency: drive toward self actualization
- Need for positive regard: relationship with no preconditions or stipulations. He thinks most people don't have this
	- Conditions of Worth: social conditions that must be met before the individual is given positive regard
- Fully Functioning Person: Leads a "congruent" lifestyle (not directed by conditions of worth)
- Rogers introduced a person centered approach: therapist creates a supportive and accepting environment and goes at the client's own pace 

  ### Trait Theories
  - Essential Trait Approach: we describe people based on how they behave 
  - Five-Factor Model (Big Five)
	  1. Openness to Experience (impulsive, spontaneous)
	  2. Conscientiousness (organized, clean, prepared)
	  3. Extraversion (outgoing, energetic)
	  4. Agreeableness (compassionate, trusting, helpful)
	  5. Neuroticism (sensitive, nervous, insecure, self-pitying)
### Humanistic Therapies:
- emphasis on a client's potential for self-fulfillment (help to be the best you)
- Nondirective Therapy: client chooses direction of therapy (not the therapist)
	- Client takes responsibility for personal feelings and actions ("Person-Centered Therapy")
	- Emphasis on present rather than past
- Role of the Therapist: therapist promotes growth rather than curing an "illness". The therapist should promote:
	- Unconditional Positive Regard (attitude of caring and acceptance for the client as a valued person). This could help parents have children that are more true to themselves
	- Empathy (attempt to understand client's perspective)
	- Active Listening: restating or paraphrasing themes in client's conversation (to foster reflection)
- Trying to achieve Congruence (Genuiness): Consistency between the way therapists feel and the way they act toward clients
