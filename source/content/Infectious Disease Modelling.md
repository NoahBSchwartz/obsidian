# Background
- Pathogen vs. Disease (Sars-CoV-2 pathogen causes Covid-19 disease)
- ILI = Influenza Like Illness (certain disease is kinda like the flu)
- NPI = Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (ie. social distancing)
- Exponential vs Gamma wait time
# Koch's Postulates
How to establish that a microbe causes a disease
1. Microbe present in all cases of disease and absent from healthy individuals
2. Microbe must be isolated and grown in pure culture (ie. we can grow microbe in dish)
3. Disease must be reproduced when pure culture is given to healthy host
4. Microbe must be reisolated from host you just infected 
Doesn't work for microbes that cause same disease, microbes that can't be grown in dish, immune hosts, asymptomatic hosts,
# Lifecycle of Disease Prevention
	Ex. Vibrio Cholerae -> Cholera (1854). 500 died in London neighborhood. John Snow found the mode of transmission:
		1. Found where the virus was centralized (pump)
		2. Hypothesized: it was the water pump
		3. Countermeasure (eg. vax, treatments, education, hand washing): removed the handle
1. Reservoir: place where agent can survive and multiply (eg. animals (eg. lyme), plants, humans (eg. tetanus), soil, water (eg. cholera))
2. Mode of Transmission:
	- Direct Transmission (you can back away and avoid it): skin-to-skin (gonorrhea), kissing (mono), soil (hookworm), droplets (pertusis)
	- Indirect Transmission (some intermediary): inanimate (needle = HIV), animate (flea = Y. pestis), airborn (smaller aerosols = Sars-Cov-2)
3. Latent = time until infectious. Incubation = time until symptoms

 # Gotchas
4. Remember separation of variables. Remember the integral of 1/x
