- Buses: wires that run throughout a system designed to carry chunks of bytes back and fourth (usually 8 bytes at a time aka 64 bits) 
- I/O Devices (Input/ Output): add things onto the system
	Ex. mouse, display, hard drive
- Main Memory: temporary storage that holds the program (and any data it manipulates) while its being executed by the processor
	- Organized as array of bytes which store each of the machine instructions in a program
- Processor (CPU): the engine that executes object file. Components:
	- Register: smallest data holding elements built into the processor
		- Program Counter: special register which contains the address of one machine-language instruction
