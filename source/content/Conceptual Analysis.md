Take a complex concept and break it up into easier to understand components
- A conceptual analysis of a concept is a set of conditions that are:
	1. Individually Necessary: Each condition must be a necessary condition
		-  Necessary Condition: x must be satisfied in order for y to be true (IF Y THEN X)
	2. Jointly Sufficient: Taken together, conditions must be sufficient 
		- Sufficient Condition: if x is sufficient condition of y then anytime x is true y is true (IF X THEN Y)
	Ex. Triangle Conceptual Analysis: 
		x is a triangle iff -> x has 3 sides, x is a polygon
- Note: (x is sufficient condit. for y) = (y is necessary condit. for x)
- To challenge Conceptual Analysis: bring up counterexample that challenges:
	1. How necessary one of the conditions is
	2. That all conditions taken together aren't jointly sufficient
	- Family Resemblance Terms: terms that are resistant to conceptual analysis
