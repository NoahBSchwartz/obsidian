We should think about our constitution differently and justify to ourselves why we need to uphold it
Main Question: How does the constitution promote, prevent, or remain silent on political and economic equality
- Writing the Constitution
	1. When writing the constitution the founders were limited to a representative system of government (no monarchy or direct democracy), limited to a federal system (with states), limited to compromising on slavery
	2. Shortcomings of the Constitution: Slavery, Suffrage, People Only Vote For House (not senators or electoral college)
		- Electoral College: winner take all for each state and then the electors vote based on that. Dahl argues it's pretty terrible but one of the reasons we kept it is so that there's usually a majority (so that the house doesn't get to decide)
	3. The Constitution wasn't sure if US would be an aristocratic or democratic republic so they just pushed it down the road
- Current Times
	1. Dahl suggests many political inequalities also cause economic inequality and vice versa
		- The electoral college is wealthy people, senators are wealthy, voting rights aren't in constitution 
	2. By having more veto points than other systems and more institutional rules that work against political equality, the US system has less political equality
	3. If many people agree on something
