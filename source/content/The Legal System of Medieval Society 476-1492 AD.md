# Early Middle Ages (476-1250) Absolutism 
The foundation of the legal system in the modern age is the medieval times
1. Feudalism (Birth determines everything): People weren't considered equal because of families they're born into
	- Corporative Society: an individual has no rights. They only get rights because they belong to certain groups
		ie. Serfs have rights (and travel with the land) but Slaves are property and have no rights
	- Theocratic Society: they thought this is what god wanted
2. If someone breaks the social order then the power punishes them
	- Jurisdictional Power: a state has the ultimate power to distribute justice (in the name of god)
# Late Middle Ages (1250-1500) Sharing Power
King gains more and more power in each territory (goes from judge to legislator, enacting laws -> parliamentary established)
1. Sources of Law: customary law, royal law (king enacts law), IUS Commune (single religious law for all of Europe applies where royal and customary law fail)
	(There are more [[Early Modern Age (1400-1600)]])
2. Magna Carta: legitimated participation of the kingdom (Pactum Subjectionis)
	- Allows the kingdom to control the king when he acts as a legislature (not absolutism anymore!)
3. King acquired more territory so he needed more institutions (royal institution represents the king when he's not around)
