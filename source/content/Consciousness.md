Anything that captures your immediate attention 
# Levels of Awareness
- William James thought of the mind as a continuous stream of consciousness
- Modern-day psychology sees it more as levels:
	- Higher-Level Consciousness: 
		- Executive Function: higher order complex processes (thinking, decision-making, problem solving)
		- Controlled Processing: active focus on attaining a goal (most alert state)
			- Selective Attention: the way that we can block out distractions
			- Flow: state of optimal experience arising from intense immersion
	- Lower-Level Consciousness: 
		- Automatic Processes: consciousness with little demands on attention (done without thinking)
		- Daydreaming: where the mind wanders without you wanting it to
	- Subconscious Awareness: Dividing line between what we're aware of and not aware of
		- Incubation: semiconscious work on solution to a problem
		- Priming: when some stimulus makes you think of certain things
	- Altered State of Consciousness: Alteration in current perceptions, thoughts and feelings (sleep, meditation, psychoactive drugs). Cognition becomes shallow and careless, self-perception and perception of the world changes
- Hypnosis: altered state invoked by relaxation techniques and characterized by a responsiveness to suggestion. Discovered by Franz Anton Mesmer
	- Susceptibility: degree to which people comply with hypnotic suggestion (ie. willingness to be hypnotized) 
	- Applications: getting eyewitness testimony, hypnotherapy, pain control
# Sleep 
#### Stages of Sleep (EEG Helped us figure this out)
- Stage W: Awakened state of alertness or relaxation
	- Beta Waves: High frequency patterns lead to concentration and alertness 
	- Alpha Waves: Low frequency patterns lead to relaxation and drowsiness
- Stage N1 (Non-REM1): Light sleep
	- Myoclonic Jerks: Quick muscle activity
- Stage N2 (Non-REM2): Deeper Sleep (ex. power naps)
	- Sleep Spindles: Sudden bursts of brain activity
	- Theta Waves: Even lower frequency brain activity (occurs when sleeping)
- Stage N3 (Non-REM3): Deepest Sleep
	- Delta Waves (slow wave sleep): Lowest frequency brain activity 
- Stage R (Rapid Eye Movement): "Paradoxical sleep" because nervous system is active while voluntary muscles hardly move (beta and gamma)
	- Gamma Waves: Highest frequency brain activity
	- REM is how you charge up your brain, and other cycles are charging up your body
- Primacy and Recency Effect: Most people recall dreams during the first (primacy)and last (recency) part of their sleep periods. The more emotional the dream, the more you'll remember it
#### Chronotype (Natural Sleep Cycle)
- Average night sleep is very hard to track down
- Circadian Rhythms: physical changes that follow daily sleep-wake cycles
	- Biological clocks can sometime become desynchronized
	- Suprachiasmatic Nucleus: releases melatonin to make you sleepy when the day gets dark
- Usual Cycle:
	- In an average night you travel up and down the stages around 4-6 times
	- Each cycle takes about  90 minutes
	- As the night progresses, less time is spent in N3 and more time spent between N2 and REM
	- REM duration gets longer as the night goes on
- Developmental Changes:
	- Babies spend a ton of time in REM sleep, teens spend less, and adults spend even less
#### Sleep Disorders
- Insomnia: Inability to sleep leading to fatigue from sleep deprivation
	- They spend a ton of time in N1 (very light sleep) so it doesn't feel like they sleep
- Hypersomnia: Fatigue despite greater than average sleeping habits 
- Narcolepsy: Abrupt shift from active waking state to several minutes of REM sleep
- Sleep Apnea: Choking and gasping for breath disrupts sleep
- Night Terrors
- Somnambulism: Condition of sleep involving motor activity (sleepwalking)
#### Dreams
- Psychodynamic Theory (Freud): dreams represent concealed unconscious wishes and desires
- Activation-Synthesis Theory: dreams result from forebrain's attempt to find logic in random neural signals from lower brain regions
- REM sleep dreams are more emotional and more illogical (in contrast with non-REM sleep dreams)
# Psychoactive Drugs
- Characteristics:
	- Physical Dependence: physical need for drug that causes withdrawal symptoms
	- Tolerance: need to take increasing amounts of drug to get same effect
	- Psychological Dependencies: craving for drug use based on emotional reasons
- Fall into: stimulants (increase behavior/mental activity), opiates/ opioids (reduce pain and produce pleasure), depressants (decrease behavior/mental activity), hallucinogens (change perceptions, thoughts, emotions)
