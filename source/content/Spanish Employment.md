So important because: Social Benefits are linked to employment
1. 1980 Reform: Spanish labor market was considered rigid (very costly to hire or fire someone b/c of social benefits) and so needed reforms
	- Flexibilization led to increase in temporary jobs but worsened wages and working conditions 
2. 2020 Temporary Redundancy Program (ERTEs): During Covid redundant positions disappeared from companies, gov tried to cushion the blow
3. 2020 Minimum Vital Income (MVI): Non-contributory Social Security (indefinitely financed through taxex). Approved in Congress of Deputies unanimously to curb high economic inequality (depends exclusively on wealth level)
	- Benefits 2.1 million people, $3 billion cost
	- New Social Right: Spanish citizens cannot be below a certain income level
4. 2021 Reform: tries to put an end to precariousness and high unemployment introduced in 80s by restricting temporary contracts (default job is permanent). Used fixed-discontinuous contract (workers employed during certain times of year but come back each year)
	- Key Issues: creating jobs to improve economy (mismatch between job offers and workers' skill), addressing underground employment (high immigrant unemployment rate), reorganizing labor structure (high youth unemployment rate)
		- 15.7% temporary jobs vs 10.1% in EU. 2021 led to significant drop (and huge increase in fixed-discontinuous contracts)
		- Most people prefer public-sector jobs
