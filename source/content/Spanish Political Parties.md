More polarization has emerged because of Podemos vs Vox and radicalization of nationalisms (See [[Composition of Spain (Federal-Regional Structure 1978-Present)]])
1. Conservative: want state and market separated
	- Popular Party (1989): center-right party
	- Vox (2013): far-right
	- Ciudadanos (2015): center-right party (in crisis in the last years)
2. Socialists (Social Democrat 1879): Not radical socialism just moderate left! Try to combine role of state and market 
	ie. increase taxes and increase services (Social Security for all)
	- Podemos (2014): radical left-wing party
	- Sumar (2024): leftist oriented
3. Nationalist/ Regionalist parties in Basque Country, Catalonia, Galicia, Valencia, Canary Islands...
4. Electoral-professional parties: appeal to the "opinion electorate." Stress on issues and leadership
	- Financing through interest groups and public funds
# Funding
- 90% is public funding (given public funds according to number of seats they obtain)
	- Makes it very hard for new parties, but access to state and radio is free of charge (money plays much bigger role in US)
- Interest Groups
	- (Weak) Neo-Corporatist Arrangements: negotiate working conditions, salaries, and other aspects with individual companies on behalf of workers (like a union)
	- Confederacion Espanola de Organizaciones Empressiales (Spanish Confederation of Employers Organizations): represents Spanish business community and negotiates w national gov 
	- Trade union which bargains w gov
		- Union General de Trabajadores (General Union of Workers)
		- Comisiones Obreras (Worker's Commisions)
# Mass Media
Owned by 4 main groups: Atresmedia, Mediaset España, Prisa, Vocento
- Only 67% of Spaniards use internet daily!
- Press: El País, El Mundo are most trust-worthy for national issues
- Television: Public and Commercial channels, regional channels tell about cities
- Radio: generally very good for info and entertainment  (public, commercial, church-controlled)
