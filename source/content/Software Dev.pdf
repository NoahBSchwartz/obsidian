Saas = Software as a service
Paas = Platform as a service (Azure, Render) gives whole infrastructure to deploy website
Iaas = Infrastructure as a service: hardware provided but you need to decide OS, middleware...
Need to know all commands that you used in docker (need to know about docker compose.yaml)
What kind of typing does Javascript use for its variables (Dynamic, don't specify type when declaring variable `let`)
In the context of Agile, what does the phrase "Definition of Done", with respect to a user story, refer to?  (The acceptance criteria that a user story must be met to be considered complete.)
Product backlog has all epics and all user stories you need to eventually build
Sprint backlogs are all tasks you need to preform in a given week (aka sprint cycle)
Non-Functional Requirements: Requirements from developer's perspective (how you do something)
Functional Requirements: Requirements from business perspective, all the functionality you need (what you need to do)

- `employees[1].lastName` works
Post is used for creating resources. Put is used for updating resources. Get is used to fetch existing resource
400: Resource Not Found, 300: redirect, 500: internal server errors 
### Front End
- HTML and CSS
	- `id = "xxxx"` to label tags, `class="classname"`: ties it into a group for style, `style="xxxxx"`: xxx list of style elements
```html
<html>  
	<head> 
	    <style type="text/css">
        h1 {  
            color: black; 
        }
        #specialParagraph {
            color: red;
            font-weight: bold;
        }
    </style>
    //or include external reference:
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="./resources/css/style.css" />
	</head>  
	<body>  
		<img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/1805164/pexels-photo-1805164.jpeg" alt="An image of a dog" width="220px" />
		<a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a> <br>
		 <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
		 <p id="specialParagraph">This has style. </p>
	</body>  
</html>
```
- Javascript: modify, create, delete HTML and CSS with tags (Event-Driven: Function runs when events trigger it)
	- `<script>`  can be declared either within the head or the body (including in head could slow loading of page down). Use `async` to load elements in parallel that don't matter to webpage (ie.  advertisements). Use `defer` to load elements in parallel that do matter to webpage (ie. pictures)
	 - Event Handlers: Dictates the actions that follow events. Events "bubble upwards" so if button is in box on website and the user clicks, the whole website will register click
 ```HTML
<html>  
  <body>  
  //change HTML using get element
	<h1 onclick="alert('You clicked this heading');"> Click Here! </h1>
	<p id="demo"> </p>
	//use html to call a function
	<div onmouseover="mOver(this);" onmouseout="mOut(this);" style="background-color:yellow; height:20px; padding:40px;">
	<script> //anything within script auto-executes
	  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML="."; //getElementByID is method, .innerHTML is property
	  document.getElementById("demo").backgroundColor = "blue"; //change CSS
	  function mOver(obj) {
        obj.innerHTML = "Moused Over";
      }
      //create HTML 
      var newDiv = document.createElement('div');
	  var newAnchor = document.createElement('a');
	  newDiv.append(newAnchor); //Helps you add content to an HTML element
	  document.body.appendChild(paragraph);//add HTML element to another HTML element
	</script>  
  </body>  
</html>  
//or include an external js sheet
<html>
	<head>
		<script src="./resources/js/script.js"></script>
	</head>
</html>
```
- JQuery: Javascript library which lets you write things short
```js
//now buttons can be defined and used in 1 line
(“button”).click(function(){alert(‘button clicked’);})
```
- Callback Function: a function passed into another function as an argument. Important for things like API calls where things need to happen asynchronously but also happen in right order
	- Higher-Order Function: the outside function which accepts the callback function
	- `setTimeout`: offloads a task for the browser to process
### Back End
NodeJS can: create HTML on the fly, manipulate files on the server, process form data, manipulate DB, has multiple threads
```js
//WebPage Code
<form action="http://URL"> //url is name of script on server
<form method="GET"> //sends small amount of data
<form method="POST"> //sends lot of data with security
<form action="localhost:<PORT_NUMBER>/getRecipeById?recipeID=1"> //call function /getRecipeById and pass recipeID = 1 in
//Server Code
const dbConfig = {
	host: 'localhost',
	port: 5432,
	database: 'recipes_db',
	user: 'postgres',
	password: 'pwd'
};
const db = pgp(dbConfig);
app.get('/', function(req,res){ //default functions, always runs when page loads
	res.send('<h1>Hello World<h1>');
})
app.get('/getRecipeById', (req, res) => { //when /getRecipeById is called, run function
    let rId = req.query.id; //read data in the request
    let query = `SELECT * FROM recipes WHERE recipeId = ${rId};`;
    db.any(query)
    .then((rows) => {
        res.send(rows); //send the response from the database back to the client
    })
});
```
```js
app.get('/getRecipeByName/:name', (req,res) => { } //use :name as another way to pass value (ie. localhost:<PORT_NUMBER>/getRecipeByName/tirimisu)
app.post('/users', (req, res) => {} //Used to create new resources on the server. Like creating new user in database
app.put('/users/:id', (req, res) => {}//Used for updating existing resources
```
- Handelbar: insert dynamic content into webpage (if apple typed into search bar, only images of apples are shown). Syntax: `{{> myPartial}}`
```html
//resources/css/style.css
<div class="container">
	<h1>{{message}}<h1>
```
```js
const hbs = handlebars.create({...});
app.get('/getRecipeByName/:name', (req,res) => { 
	//res.send is for static data, instead use:
	{{> head.hbs}}
	res.render(`pages/home`,{
		my_title: "Home",
		stylesheet : "../resources/css/style.css"
		message : "Welcome to this demo"
	}
}
//head.hbs 
{{#each data}} //equivalent to using a for loop to print array when rendering
	<tr>
		<td>{{recipe}}</td>
		<td>{{times}}</td>
	</tr>
{{/each}}
{{#if first_name}}
	<title> {{first_name}} - CSCI 
	3308 Lab 7 </title>
	{{else}}
	<title> CSCI 3308 Lab 7 </title>
{{/if}}
  ```
### Databases 
  - ACID: Atomicity (if data moved from one place but doesn't get put in another place, the transaction reverses), Consistency (different rows should always agree), Isolation: (transactions occur independently you may not see most updated values), Durability: Once a transaction occurs, it will be permanently locked in
- Searching Through Database: use primary key
	- Composite Key: consists of two or more columns (ie. Noah, Comp Sci)
	- Primary Key: the main way of identifying rows. There can be only one primary key. Can be composite for more specificity 
		- Alternate Key (AK): other keys that could be primary keys if needed
	- Surrogate Key: artificial column added to a relational database to act as primary key (for increased efficiency)
	- Foreign Key: key of one relation that is placed in another relation to form a link between relations
		- Referential Integrity Constraint: limits the values of the foreign key to those existing in primary key (of relation `#1`
- SQL
	- NOT NULL: requires that a field be set when a new entry is added to the table.
	- SERIAL: creates an auto-increment that is managed by the database. Each time a new entry is added to the table, the SERIAL column is set and the value is incremented by 1
	-  VARCHAR(#): A variable-length character string, where # defines the maximum number of characters
	- TEXT: similiar to the VARCHAR(#) data type, but removes the character limit
```
CREATE TABLE students(
	studentId BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
	first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
);
INSERT INTO mytable(val1,val2,str3) VALUES (1,2,'hi'), (3,4,'yo'), (5,6,'wow')

// Add up all units which match category_id
SELECT category_id, SUM(units_in_stock)
FROM products
GROUP BY category_id;
HAVING SUM(units_in_stock) > 100; //filter sums

SELECT p.name, COUNT(m.id)
FROM platforms p
JOIN movies m ON p.id = m.platform_id
GROUP BY p.id
ORDER BY COUNT(m.id) DESC
LIMIT 1;

//update
UPDATE movies
SET platform_id = (
	SELECT id
	FROM platforms
	WHERE name = 'Netflix'
)
WHERE year_of_release = 2004;

ALTER TABLE table_name  
ADD COLUMN new_column_name data_type constraint;

//inner join
SELECT  
	employee.name,  
	salary.current_salary  
FROM  
	employee  
	INNER JOIN salary
		ON employee.id = salary.employee_id;
```
### Git Stuff
- Regex: `(^CSCI [0-9][0-9][0-9][1,3,5,7,9])` this gets all odd numbered courses ie. 1003, 2935...
- Clear terminal: `clear`, Go back a directory: `cd ..` (to go back multiple: `cd ../../..`), To relocate a file: `mv ./folder1/sample.txt ../folder2`, Search for a phrase in file: `grep "test" file.txt`,  Change file permission to make it executable: `chmod +x file.sh` 
- Piping: if you want to pass output of one command to another command ie. `grep "test" file.txt | tee output.txt` (tee is write command)
  - Print contents of file: `cat file.cpp`, Print head of file: `head`, Print tail of file: `tail`
	- Write to file: `echo "Hello World" > sample.txt` (overwrites), Append to file: `echo "Hello World" >> sample.txt`
- Vim: another way to modify file. Create file: `vi sample.txt`, When in file, press `i` to start typing (press esc to exit insert mode), Exit file: `:q` or `:wq` (write and quit to save file before exiting) 
- Docker: `docker compose down -v` (end docker and remove volumes)
- `docker compose up -d`
- See all Containers: `docker ps -a` See Running Containers: `docker ps` Remove Containers: `docker rm hello_world_container`
- Run an image interactively: `docker run -it ubuntu` To exit: `exit`
- View all running instances: `docker compose ps`

- `git rebase`: when there are changes in main that we want to reflect and bring our branch to the same state as main
- `git fetch`: pulls all new branches from main so they can be in local repo, `git checkout`: navigate between branches created by fetch
- `git rm`: remove files that have been staged for commit but are no longer needed, `git rm --cached` (will only remove from staging area)
- `git stash`: store/save your current changes safely in one place so that you can work on something else and come back to project `git stash -u:` stashes untracked
