Neurons can communicate directly or indirectly with each other 
# Processes
1. Neural Chain: the chain of events that produces neural communication
2. Receptor: the neuron's specialized cells that activate when there is a stimulus
# Types
- Sensory Neuron: they carry incoming information from sense receptors -> to the brain
- Interneurons: they carry information from neurons in the brain and the spinal cord 
- Motor Neurons: carry outgoing information from the brain to muscles 
# Parts
- Transmission Phase (Presynaptic):
	1.  Info comes into the Dendrites: tree-like structures that branch out from the soma.
		- Sometime this info is in the form of things like sensory input and nerve input
		- But they can also come from [[Neuromodulators]]: chemicals that activate neural activity. They can come from your brain, body, or outside your body
	2. Then it travels through the Soma: the cell body (it's the growth and maintenance part of the neuron)
	3. It exits through the Axon: cylindrical structure that carries neural impulses from soma to other neurons 
		- Myelin Sheath: goes around axon to speed up the transmission of neural impulses
		- There are gaps in the myelin to let neural impulses jump down axon for even quicker communication
	4. Terminal Buttons: knobs at the end of the axon. They can burst open with the right chemical signals (action potential) to fly to other neurons
		- This is a Neural Impulse: the message sent from one neuron to another  
		- The message is in the form of a [[Neurotransmitter]]: the chemicals located in the terminal buttons 
- Finally, this impulse travels across the Synapse: the gap between the first and the second neuron
- Reception Phase (Postsynaptic):
	1. Many neurons can be triggered from one simple chemical release, it just depends on neural layout
- Integration Phase:
	1. Neurons assess and integrate the incoming information
