- Learning leads us to do what’s good for us so it can be thought of like optimization. Many times we don’t even know it’s happening and it shapes our beliefs (ie. Igloo design, wrong belief about eating selfish)
    1. Reinforcement: we’ll exhibit the behavior most needed to get a reward
    2. Repeating: if we watch other better people, eventually we’ll get better too
- The tastes of people in different parts of the world developed to counteract effect (ie. Spicy foods kill bacteria)
- You need to learn to play the hawk when people expect you to (think about the hawk-dove model in interactions to figure out when) ie. When you get to a seat first, don’t give it up
# My Thoughts
There are a ton of different puzzles in each chapter that seem very unrelated and irrational but if you look for the common thread they all suddenly make sense (ie higher order punishment)

Speaking indirectly, being passive aggressive, using innuendos… allows you to commmnicate something between you and another party in the present but has enough deniability that nothing will change in later interactions

Focusing on primary rewards is invaluable (may even be more valuable than game theory for figuring out why people do what they do)

Crazy insight: the authors broke down passions as starting because someone has a good chance of succeeding in a field where they’ll get a lot of rewards (but only if they invest a ton of time). The kicker is the authors then extend this to a sense of meaning in life: you get meaning from doing things that will be socially rewarded. You can’t get meaning from eating or doing chores but you can get meaning from donating and helping out

- they extend this even further to grit. Grit is more likely to develop when someone is in a field where they need to work towards a long term goal. But it’s more likely to develop if the person has a better chance at succeeding, if the cost is worth it to get the rewards. This is why privileged kids may develop more grit (and why someone who’s bad at most things will develop a ton of grit in one area, because the costs to spending time elsewhere lower)
- This is why you lose motivation when you’re paid for a task: getting paid is a sign that the task doesn’t have enough social benefits to get you to do it without payment (and social benefits = motivation)

The most important lesson of the book is to focus on the costs and benefits, the primary rewards. Game theory is just a tool for doing this
