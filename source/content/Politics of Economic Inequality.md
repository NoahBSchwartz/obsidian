### 1. Normative Issues Surrounding Economic Inequality 
1. The first step is to establish when inequality is a problem, when it's neutral, or when it's positive
	- People have a built-in instinct for fairness and we can use this to figure it out (but note that this is one interpretation of human nature)
		- Human Nature Interpretations
			1. Liberalism: human nature is good and society corrupts them (wants max amount of liberty)
			2. Capitalism: human nature is just self-interested and competitive and society can use this (wants max amount of liberty)
			3. Socialism: human nature is cooperative and competition corrupts (doesn't want a ton of liberty, wants to regulate competition)
			4. Conservatism: human nature is bad and society must force them to be good (doesn't want a ton of liberty, wants a lot of gov.)
			5. Existential Nihilism: human nature is indeterminate and meaning is constructed by society (advocates for a lot of government)
		- We don't have to rely on our particular interpretation being right to fix inequality 
			- If human nature is bad, it's still in everyone's best interest to distribute resources evenly enough so wars don't break out
			- If human nature is socially constructed, institutions and policies are very important because they can create good people
	- This instinct means humans feel they must live in an equal society
		- Equality of Outcome: This is very complicated because the equality of outcome is different for different things (ie. everyone has a right to food but not everyone has a right to eat at a luxury restaurant)
		- Equality of Opportunity: 2 definitions with very different undertones
			1. If everyone has an equal ability to use their talents and their luck to pursue success then the condition is just
			2. If everyone has an equal ability to use the choices they make then the condition is just (luck gives an unfair advantage and if luck is involved then the condition is unjust)
	Takeaway:
		 Economic inequality is a problem when it's caused by unequal opportunity, discrimination, political inequality, transmitted between generations. If it causes harm and inequality then it's a problem 
		 Economic inequality is good when it's caused by unequal effort/talent, causes people to reach their potential, causes people to help the public good
		 We should promote equal economic opportunity, equal political opportunity (equal voting access) but should we promote equal economic and political outcome (ie. reparations, equal representation)
2. Measuring Economic Inequality:
	- Traditional: Look at a bunch of variables to see which ones effect economic inequality (but indicators are not a great way to do this)
	- Bottleneck Approach: look at key points in people's life and see the factors that go into each of those
	- Relative Deprivation: when someone doesn't have something he wants but sees that others do have it (worse than normal deprivation because you can see how possible it is to get)
		- Sometimes, a person might set the bar too high and give themselves relative deprivation. Sometimes a person might set the bar too low and accept their conditions when they should be experiencing deprivation (ie. adaptive preferences)
			- Very tricky metric because people can mess it up in their own heads but also important because it undermines people's self respect (which is critical to them contributing to society and trying to reach their full potential)
	- Gini Index: 0 is complete equality and 1 is complete inequality (it's about distribution so 0 means everyone has the same and 1 means a single person has all wealth)
		- Very interesting: the gini index of the US has risen steadily over the past 30 years
3. Comparing Our Democracy to Other Countries: Useful because political inequality leads to economic inequality
	- We're the only democracy with a 4 veto player system (to prevent tyranny of the majority), the rest have less than we do. This 4 veto player system has been shown to increase inequality
		- We have a huge imbalance in representation, we greatly over-represent the citizens of smaller states
	- Dangerous Political Myths: 
		- The US has 50 states which all experiment to get best policy outcome (Debunk: every state has Gini scores lower than other countries)
		- Inequality is the price we pay for diversity (Debunk: other countries have as much immigration as we do)
		- Americans like and have limited government (Debunk: we have a ton more healthcare spending than other countries but still suck)
		- We have extra social and economic mobility 
Conclusion: economic inequality can be good, bad, or neutral. It's important to look at the normative issues (the hard concrete effects) to determine how good or bad it is in certain situations
# 2. How Has Inequality Changed Over-Time
The loss of shared prosperity: up until the 1970's when things were good everyone benefitted and when they were bad everyone paid
1. Causes: Deregulating Business: this led to the wealthier class pulling away from the lower class
2. Effects: Different classes start going against each other (starting to lead to class-based politics), People become less hopeful... 
- Inequality Across Race, Gender, and Background: Economic Inequality is bad when it's divided along these lines
	- Family Structure: family composition has changed over time 
		- Almost a quarter of US children live in single-parent homes, more than in any other country (disproportionately distributed by race)
			- People of different races and of lower economic security are more likely to cohabitate
		- 29% of US households are 1 person, in 1960 it was only 13%
		- People with college degrees are now MORE likely to get married (a reversal from the past)
	- Racial Disparities in Family Income haven't declined in 40 years. Hypotheses:
		1. Socioeconomic status is transmitted from parents to children
		2. Changing family compositions offsets all of the positive change we've tried to create
	- Gender Disparities in Family Income have declined but aren't 0: Mothers work much less than fathers (much further apart than single men and single women)
