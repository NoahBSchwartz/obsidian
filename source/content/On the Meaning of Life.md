Axiom 1: The one and only meaning of life is to be as happy as possible

- Theorem: Maximizing happiness should be the single goal of life
- Theorem: Nothing else in life matters but increasing happiness
- Theorem: Every action I complete should in some way and at some point help to maximize happiness
- Theorem: Sacrificing happiness in the short term in exchange for happiness in the long term is acceptable if long term happiness > short term happiness

Axiom 2: Relationships with others, lack of extreme stress, novelty, access to short and long-term pleasures, free will, and the cooperation of biology are the only external factors needed for happiness (sometimes even these aren’t completely necessary)
(Note: according to psychology the factors are (1) positive emotion and pleasure, (2) engagement in life, and (3) living a meaningful life)
- Theorem: Beyond increasing these values to their maximums, excess money is useless to gain external happiness
- Theorem: Lack of stress dictates that ignorance is bliss if and only if it lasts a lifetime

Axiom 3: Feeling of self-worth, enjoyment of small pleasures,

- Money is more useful to gain internal happiness
