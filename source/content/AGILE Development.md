Client is constantly involved (more expensive at the start of the project but better as project goes on because it guarantees the client is happy)
### Scrum
1. Get input from stakeholders (clients, project team, managers)
	- Put input into Product Backlog (list of features needed for development)
2. Team has a Sprint Planning Meeting to figure out which features to prioritize
	- Put this plan into Sprint Backlog 
3. Task Breakout: each member of the team picks a task that they want to complete
4. Meetings
	- There are standup meetings every 24 hrs where each member explains what they're doing
	- Ending cycle (every 2 weeks)
		- There is a sprint review where team reflects on its work
		- There are sprint retrospectives where team talks with client to see what they could have done better
	- Start the next one
5. Scum Master: takes notes during the standups and then contacts different members of the team to resolve blockers
	- They're not a manager, they don't assign tasks or order people around
