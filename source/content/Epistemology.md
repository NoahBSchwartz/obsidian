- Belief: You can either believe X, disbelieve X, or suspend judgement on X
- Credence: Subjective Probability (how much you believe X)
- JTB (Justified True Belief) Theory of Knowledge: Someone knows X is true if and only if:
	1. Someone believes X
	2. Someone has adequate justification for X
	3. X is true
	- Note: in order to know something, you need to show that it can't be disproven (ie. you can't prove that demons exist)
	- A lot of work has been done to get rule 4: 
		- Trial 1: Someone cannot have inferred that X from a false belief
		- Trial 2: If X were false then someone wouldn't believe X
- Social Epistemology: Traditional epistemology focusses on individuals, but knowledge is a deeply social process
	- Looks at how social features and members of community shape what we know
	- Epistemic Communities
		1. Epistemic Bubble: type of community where outside voices aren't heard
		2. Echo Chamber: type of community where outside sources of info are actively silenced or undermined in their trustworthiness
			- Social Epistemic Reboot: to escape echo chamber, temporary suspend all beliefs and start again
			- If someone else is in echo chamber, try to establish trust with them
	- Epistemic Traps
		- Inquiry Trap: a belief system that's made so that attempts at inquiry give false answers in order to reinforce the belief system
		- Insensitivity Trap: belief system that selectively cuts off attention to areas of life by making them seem valueless 
	- Intellectual Playfulness must be
		1. Autotelic: done for the sake of engaging in the activity
		2. Involves Perspective Shifting: temporarily inhabiting alternate belief systems
		- This is how you break out of epistemic traps
			- Pollman Effect: if a community shares all evidence all the time, it gets to the truth slower than one which selective shares
			- Best method: many sub communities all investigating their own hyoptheses
	- Problem of Irrelevant Influence: many of our beliefs are influenced by factors that aren't relative to the truth (ie. beliefs rely on who your family is)
		- Genealogical Anxiety: worry that you'd have different beliefs if you grew up in a different context
